# Info for use in constructing the inter-zone diagnostic plots of all

---
types:
  # A dict giving info for each type of emission line: husl is the key
  # color, zone is which zone's brightness to use for color mapping,
  # log_min, log_max map log10 brightness (units of H beta = 100) on
  # to the lightest and darkest color in the color map
  # 
  # These are mainly the same colors as in zones.yaml, maybe change
  # them later
  Unidentified:
    description: >-
      All unidentified emission lines, even if they might not be Deep
      Neutral ones

  Deep:
    description: >-
      Deep Neutral lines with a confirmed identification. This
      currently includes only the [C I] 8727 line

    zone: zone-I
    log_min: -2.5
    log_max: -0.5
  Low:
    description: >-
      Forbidden lines from the ionization front and close to it, such
      as [O I], [S II], [N II], [O II]
    husl: [290, 85, 30]         # a medium purple (darkened)
    zone: zone-II
    log_min: -2.0
    log_max: 1.0
  Medium:
    description: >-
      Medium ionization recombination lines (H I and He I) and
      forbidden lines, such as [S III], [Cl III], [Ar III], [O III]
    husl: [352, 90, 40]         # a nice magenta (darkened)
    zone: zone-III
    log_min: -2.0
    log_max: 2.0
  High:
    description: >-
      High ionization lines, such as He II, [Ar IV], [Cl IV], [K IV], Si III
    husl: [30, 100, 50]          # an intense orange (darkened, and slightly yellower)
    zone: zone-IV
    log_min: -2.0
    log_max: 0.0
  Fe:
    description: >-
      Lines from Fe, Ni, Si, Ca that show distributions that are
      somewhat different from the Neutral and Low types. For example:
      [Fe II], [Ni II], Si II, [Fe III], Ca I. Note that this category
      is rather miscellaneous.
