* Emission line extraction and analysis from MUSE datasets of HII regions
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: README
:END:
+ New project [2021-05-04 Tue]
+ Two principal aims:
  1. Analyzing velocity statistics, such as structure functions
     - Collaboration with Javier García Vázquez
  2. Looking for Raman-scattered Balmer wings
     - Collaboration with Mabel Valerdi 

** Learning to use MPDAF
I have made a series of notebooks

*** 00 Series: short demos of MPDAF functionality
**** 00 00 MPDAF simple demo
+ Notebook: [[file:notebooks/00-00-MPDAF-simple-demo.ipynb][00-00-MPDAF-simple-demo.ipynb]]
+ Pure python: [[file:notebooks/00-00-MPDAF-simple-demo.py][00-00-MPDAF-simple-demo.py]]
+ Reading in the data cube, summing all waves to get an image, summing all pixels to get a spectrum
**** 00 01 Extract sub-regions
+ Notebook: [[file:notebooks/00-01-extract-subregions.ipynb][00-01-extract-subregions.ipynb]]
+ Pure python: [[file:notebooks/00-01-extract-subregions.py][00-01-extract-subregions.py]]
+ Extract spectral ranges and spatial regions of the data cube
  + Use of masks in 2D and 3D

*** 01 Series: longer exercises in extracting line ratio diagnostics

**** 01 00 Line Ratios
+ Notebook: [[file:notebooks/01-00-line-ratios.ipynb][01-00-line-ratios.ipynb]]
+ Pure python: [[file:notebooks/01-00-line-ratios.py][01-00-line-ratios.py]]
+ Mainly concentrating on the [S II] 6716,31 lines for now
  + Demonstrates a novel (I believe) technique of compensating for uncertainties in the zero-point, which makes use of the known line ratio in the low-density limit
  + Makes use of ~pandas~ and ~seaborn~ libraries to plot joint distributions of extracted line intensities


*** 02 Series: extraction of the Raman-scattered wings to Balmer lines

**** 02 00 Line Ratios
+ Notebook: [[file:notebooks/02-00-raman-wings.ipynb][02-00-raman-wings.ipynb]]
+ Pure python: [[file:notebooks/02-00-raman-wings.py][02-00-raman-wings.py]]
+ Yes, we find the wings in NGC 346
  + We have to mask out about 60% of the spatial pixels that are contaminated with stars in order to see it properly
  + Makes use of ~regions~ library to select boxes in the image
    
*** TODO 03 Series: exercises with velocity moments

** N66/NGC 346 in the SMC
+ N66 is the H II region, while NGC 346 is technically the star cluster, but the H II region is also sometimes referred to as this
+ Data are at [[file:~/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/SMC-NGC-346/ADP.2017-10-16T11_04_19.247.fits][SMC-NGC-346/ADP.2017-10-16T11_04_19.247.fits]]
+ Papers on NGC 346
  + Valerdi:2019a Helium abundance
    + Measures physical conditions too:
      + [O III] Te = 13000 K
      + ne = 20-30 ([O II] and [S II]) up to 100 ([Fe III])
*** Velocity maps
+ Looks like this will be possible for the brighter lines at least
+ There is a problem that seems to be an overzealous background subtraction, which means that some of the lines come out negative
  + We can maybe fix this by adding on the spectrum seen in the darkest corner of the image

* Export the README.md file                       :noexport:
+ Type ~C-c C-e C-s g g~ in the first heading
