# # Kinematics of [O III] with PZ cube
#
# We will calculate the velocity moments for [O III] from the Peter Zeidler cube to compare with the ones we already calculated for H alpha, and also with the [O III] measurements from the pipeline ESO cube.  There are some advantages in using [O III] over H alpha:
#
# * There are two lines with a known ratio, which allows checking the intensity zero-point easily
# * Thermal broadening is less
# * Photospheric absorption is less
#
# On the other hand, there is at least one disadvantage:
#
# * The spectral resolution is lower (in velocity units)
#

# Load libraries and data cube (identical to earlier notebooks):

# The distributions are very consistent between the two [O III] lines.  They are also quite similar to H alpha, especially in the mid-range of intensity.
#
# Unlike in the ESO cube, there is not really a bimodal distribution in the velocities of either line. The marginal histogram is single-peaked, with a maximum at about 162 km/s. 
#
# However, on the joint I-v distribution, we can see evidence of a multi-peaked structure. The 162 km/s peak corresponds to the intermediate brightness values. Lower brightness values have a distinct peak at 159 km/s. And then the brightest pixels also seem to move twoards slightly bluer velocities (160 km/s). Finally, the intermediate brightnesses show a "spike" towards higher velocities: 165 km/s.  
#
# The line width does not vary with velocity, but there is some evidence for structure in the I-sigma plot.

# Now look at the cross-correlations between the two lines:
