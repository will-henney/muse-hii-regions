* Molecular hydrogen lines at optical wavelengths
- Now that we have established that the DRLs are actually H2, we can see what physics we can do with them


** Previous work on excitation of ro-vibrational levels in PDRs

*** Kaplan:2021a
- This seems the most recent relevant paper on the near-infrared lines
- They observe 5 regions, which include the Horse head nebula and the Orion Bar
- They detect lines up to v=14, which is the same as us
- And with v=4 they get up to J=19, which is higher than us (we maybe see up to J=13)
- They compare with a pure fluorescent spectrum, which has well separated ladders for the different v levels
  - Fluorescent spectrum has high vibrational temperature and a low rotational temperature
- The Orion Bar shows the largest deviation from this
  - Which they ascribe to collisional effects
  - They are assuming a density of 1e6 in Orion,
  - Which is way higher than what they gave in an earlier paper
    - Kaplan:2017a
    - although they never comment on this
- They look at the ortho-para ratio
  - The ortho lines have odd J
  - The para lines have even J
  - For the ground state, we expect O/P = 3 in LTE
    - But, for fluorescently excited lines, the additional optical depth increases the self-shielding for the ortho lines, which reduces the pumping efficiency and brings it down to O/P = 1.7
    - Then collisional transitions (if they are important) can take it back up to 3 again
- They determine the K-band extinction from comparing lines with shared upper levels
  - And assuming an extinction law of the form lambda^-1.8
    - Although they say that varying the index makes little difference
  - The get values around A_K = 0.7
    - Which would imply A_V = 10 if it was that steep up to the optical!
- They do show spatially resolved results
  - But hardly comment on these
  - And they are hard to interpret, since I am not sure which way their slit is going
