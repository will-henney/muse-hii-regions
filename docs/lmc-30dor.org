* MUSE cubes of 30 Dor (Tarantula) in the LMC

+ Collaboration of Will Henney with Mabel Valerdi
+ *Initial plan* [2021-06-16 Wed]
  + Mabel has reported difficulty with the first stages of data reduction:
    + She tried to follow similar steps to those in [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/02-00-raman-wings.ipynb][NGC 346 notebook]] but it was taking unreasonable amount of time (hours?)
    + This may be due to low RAM on her machine (8GB versus 64GB on mine)
  + So Will is going to carry out the initial steps and produce smaller files that Mabel's machine will be able to manage:
    1. [X] Download the data cubes from ESO archive for the 4 fields of 30Dor (A to D)
       - Note that the data cubes will not be stored in this repo (they are too big!).  But we should store the download shell scripts to make this step reproducible
    2. [X] Fit and remove continuum pixel-by-pixel
    3. [X] Divide the wavelength range into chunks of about 800 \AA and write out smaller cubes
       - For instance, the range 6100 \to 6900 is more than enough for analyzing the Raman wings of H\alpha
       - The full range is 4700 \AA and the data cubes are about 3GB, so our smaller files should be about 6 times smaller, or 0.5GB


** Original files
+ I downloaded what looked to be the combined cubes for each of the 4 positions (with overview images)
  + A :: ADP.2016-07-14T14:17:17.826.fits
  + B :: ADP.2016-07-19T06:16:41.316.fits
  + C :: ADP.2016-07-19T11:27:30.987.fits
  + D :: ADP.2016-07-15T13:22:09.432.fits
+ Layout of the fields in RA, Dec is
  : D C
  : B A 
+ Will's local copy of the files is at
  + ~/Users/will/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/30Dor/2021-06/~
+ Overview images and log files are copied to the data folder of this repo
  + [[file:../data/lmc-30dor/]]
  + The PNG files are white light images of each field, together with 



** Cuts through interesting regions
1. The 30 Dor-10 GMC in the N
   - This has ver small offset between ionized and neutral species
2. The big clump to the SW
   - This has a nice wall that can be used for a cut through the perpendicular ionization front, akin to in the Orion Bar
3. The triangle cloud
   - Strong, limb-brightened C I 8727 emission
4. The close-in extinction cloud
   - Bright in the mystery 8152 line

   


** [Fe III] lines and a possible jet
+ Some notes in [[https://www.craft.do/s/rNuIpgvsEx8WxD][this Craft doc]]


** The H\beta Raman wing
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/lmc-30dor_att
:END:
+ This is seen best on the blue side
+ Here are some example profiles
  [[file:lmc-30dor_att/screenshot-20210809-215942.png]]
+ Note the absorption notch in the profile at observed wavelength of 4845 +/- 0.5
  + This is quite possibly another UV absorption line
  + [ ] We can try and work out what the UV rest wavelength must be


** Scattering and extinction

*** DIBs
+ We should measure the 5781 EW maps, and correlate it with the reddening
+ There is also the DIB in the red Raman wing
*** Scattered light
+ We have the broad 4686 line emission (WR blue bump)
  + Quote from Lopez-Sanchez:2010y
    : The blend of the broad He Il 14686, CITI/CIV 14650 and NII 14640 emission lines constitutes the blue WR bump; it mainly originates in WN stars with a minor contribution of WC stars.
  + This is seen all over the field - probably various WN stars and maybe contribution from hot O stars too
    + There seems to be scattering associated with the ionized gas and the neutral gas too
    + Very little evidence of limb brightening
+ We have the 5411 absorption line (albeit potentially contaminated by [Fe III] 5412 emission).  Also, it is emission in some cases
+ We have the WR red bump 5800 broad emission (broad C IV)
  + Quote from Lopez-Sanchez:2010y
    : The blend of the C III \lambda 5698 and CIV \lambda 5808 broad emission lines constitutes the red WR bump. CIV \lambda 5808 is the strongest emission line in WC stars, but it is barely seen in WN stars.
  + This is much more restricted to a nebula around the WR sat the top. Presumably this is a WC star
+ We have the WR 6680 broad emission Not sure what makes this: He I maybe?
*** Reddening
+ We have multiple reddening indicators:
  + H I 6563/4861 gives red--blue
  + H I 9229/6563 gives IR-red
  + [Ar III] 7751/7136 gives local red slope
    + [ ] Note that this ratio could be improved by doing a better sky subtraction
      + Or at least making it consistent between the 4 different sub-fields
      +This would help eliminate a jump in some of the diagnostic plots
+ There is a clump at the bottom that shows anomalously low IR-red reddening
    

** Summary of results from line extraction and mosaicking
+ [2021-08-03 Tue]
*** O++ ORLs vs CELs
+ We find that the ORL/CEL ratio increases towards the center of cluster and also towards the WR star
+ [X] Should look at correlation with [Ar IV] / [O III] and with [O III] / [O II], since they should be much better measures of excitation
  + Yes this hows a good correlation, especially with [Ar IV] / [O III] - see notebook

** Comparison with molecular gas

*** Alma observations
+ [2021-11-14 Sun] There are two sets of data that have good resolution (1 arcsec or better) that I have found so far
  1. The molecular cloud 30 Dor-10 at the far N edge of our MUSE field
     - covered in 12CO and 13CO among other lines
     - described in Indebetouw:2020x
     - these are the highest resolution observations but they cover only a small area that overlaps with MUSE
     - The integrated and peak maps are in [[file:../big-data/30-Dor-Radio/]]
       - ~Alma-2013.1.00346.S-30_doradus_13CO21-peak.fits~
       - ~Alma-2013.1.00346.S-30_doradus_13CO21-sum.fits~
  2. Three fields that cover the entire area except for the SW corner
     + The data is enormous - too big to put on Dropbox
     + Originals stored locally in ~/Users/will/Work/Alma-Data/LMC-30-Dor/2019.1.00843.S/~
     + No paper published so far
     + The best line I have found so far is in spectral window 25 (~spw25~)
       - 12CO v=0 2-1
       - Extract from the FITS header:
         #+begin_example
           CTYPE3  = 'FREQ    '                                                            
           CRVAL3  =   2.302808527260E+11                                                  
           CDELT3  =   6.103865753174E+04                                                  
           CRPIX3  =   1.000000000000E+00                                                  
           CUNIT3  = 'Hz      '
           ...
           RESTFRQ =   2.305380000000E+11 /Rest Frequency (Hz)                             
           SPECSYS = 'LSRK    '           /Spectral reference frame                        
           ALTRVAL =   3.343952551877E+05 /Alternate frequency reference value             
           ALTRPIX =   1.000000000000E+00 /Alternate frequency reference pixel             
           VELREF  =                  257 /1 LSR, 2 HEL, 3 OBS, +256 Radio       
         #+end_example
         - Apparently, ~ALTRVAL~ is the velocity of pixel 1:
           : 2.99792458e8 (2.305380000000E+11 - 2.302808527260E+11) / 2.305380000000E+11
           : = 334395.255188 m
           so that checks out.  Units are m/s
         - so velocity pixels are 2.99792458e8 6.103865753174E+04 / 2.305380000000E+11 = 79.3748933989 m/s
         - So in principal, we could change the FITS header to have
            #+begin_example
              CTYPE3  = 'VRAD'                                                            
              CRVAL3  =   3.343952551877E+05
              CDELT3  =   -79.3748933989
              CRPIX3  =   1.000000000000E+00
              CUNIT3  = 'm/s'
            #+end_example
            This says that we have "Radio Velocity", which is defined in Greisen:2006a as
     + Weaker lines:
       + spw29: 2.203986840000E+11 Hz 13CO v=0 2-1
       + spw31: 2.182221920000E+11 Hz H2CO Formaldehyde - very weak
         + Other H2CO bands are spw33 and spw35 but they are even weaker
       + spw37: 2.195603580000E+11 Hz C180 v=0 2-1 - very weak
       + So for some fields I am only downloading spw25 and spw29 to save time


**** Making moment maps and channel maps of CO

+ This is done in the notebook [[file:../notebooks/05-10-LMC-30dor-molecular-maps.ipynb]]


*** Combining ALMA maps with lower-resolution observations
+ This would be good to fill in the noisiest regions of the ALMA map, where there is not much signal
+ To do this properly is hard
  + See Kong:2018a
+ But we will do it a simpler way:
  + Take the low-resolution observations I_A (synthesized beam width W_A)
  + And the high-resolution observations I_B (synthesized beam width W_B < W_A)
  + Combine as I_A - (I_B \star K) + I_B
    + Where \star is convolution
    + And K is smoothing kernel of width W = (W_A^2 - W_B^2)^{1/2}
+ One possible problem is that the sensitivity of the two instruments could be different
  + In which case we would need to apply a scaling factor to one or the other
+ We have the option of doing it channel-by-channel or of just the integrated map
**** Maps from Okada:2019r
+ The mm maps are from APEX
  + 12CO 2-1 has HPBW of 27.1 arcsec
  + Sampled to 10 arcsec pixels
+ https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/A%2BA/621/A62
  + That is where you can download all the maps from
+ 

*** Kinematics of the CO emission
+ In many areas, there seems to be a pronounced gradient with radius: bluer at small radii, redder at large radii
+ The velocity range of the CO emission seems similar to that of the optical lines
+ Point by point comparison between CO and [S II] suggests that the velocities are at least partially correlated.
  + But I need to look at this more systematically



**** Conversion from LSRK to Barycentric
+ Radio observations tend to use Local Standard of Rest frame LSRK
  + I have a long discussion of this in [[file:../../KeckProplyd/keck-raman.org][file:~/Dropbox/KeckProplyd/keck-raman.org]]
  + I traced it back to Gordon:1976a - here is a quote:
    : The conventional reference frame used for galactic studies is essentially
    : that of standard solar motion. The convention of Local Standard of Rest	    
    : (LSR) assumes the sun to move at the rounded velocity of 20.0 km/sec toward  
    : 18h RA and 30° DEC (1900.0).
+ Optical observations tend to use heliocentric or barycentric (almost the same)
+ Here I will calculate the conversion between the two of them for 30 Dor

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : V(LSR) - V(HEL) = -15.49 km/s
+ *Conclusions*
  + V(LSR) = V(HEL) - 15.49 km/s
  + So we subtract 15.5 from the heliocentric velocities to get the LSR ones
  + This means that the systemic velocity of 265 km/s from Castro et al becomes VLSRK = 249.5 km/s
  + So the blueshifted 250 km/s clump of Ha in the I-V diagrams corresponds to VLSRK = 234.5 km/s
