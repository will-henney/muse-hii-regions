* MUSE cubes of 30 Dor (Tarantula) in the LMC

+ Collaboration of Will Henney with Mabel Valerdi
+ *Initial plan* [2021-06-16 Wed]
  + Mabel has reported difficulty with the first stages of data reduction:
    + She tried to follow similar steps to those in [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/02-00-raman-wings.ipynb][NGC 346 notebook]] but it was taking unreasonable amount of time (hours?)
    + This may be due to low RAM on her machine (8GB versus 64GB on mine)
  + So Will is going to carry out the initial steps and produce smaller files that Mabel's machine will be able to manage:
    1. [X] Download the data cubes from ESO archive for the 4 fields of 30Dor (A to D)
       - Note that the data cubes will not be stored in this repo (they are too big!).  But we should store the download shell scripts to make this step reproducible
    2. [ ] Fit and remove continuum pixel-by-pixel
    3. [ ] Divide the wavelength range into chunks of about 800 \AA and write out smaller cubes
       - For instance, the range 6100 \to 6900 is more than enough for analyzing the Raman wings of H\alpha
       - The full range is 4700 \AA and the data cubes are about 3GB, so our smaller files should be about 6 times smaller, or 0.5GB


** Original files
+ I downloaded what looked to be the combined cubes for each of the 4 positions (with overview images)
  + A :: ADP.2016-07-14T14:17:17.826.fits
  + B :: ADP.2016-07-19T06:16:41.316.fits
  + C :: ADP.2016-07-19T11:27:30.987.fits
  + D :: ADP.2016-07-15T13:22:09.432.fits
+ Will's local copy of the files is at
  + ~/Users/will/Work/Muse-Hii-Data/30Dor/2021-06/~
+ Overview images and log files are copied to the data folder of this repo
  + [[file:../data/lmc-30dor/]]
