* Cloudy models of vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen in NGC 346
- [2023-06-12 Mon] We want to model the optical wavelength ro-vibrational lines that we identified as Deep Red Lines
- Priorities are as follows:
  1. Make a complete line list, so we can see whether *all* the DRLs are H2 lines or not
     - This should be enough for the revisions to the first paper
  2. Make an excitation diagram for the observed lines, so we can see if they are consistent with a single temperature or if it looks like fluorescence
  3. Find lines that share the same upper level, so we can estimate the reddening and hence the extinction
 
** Input scripts
- The plan is to combine features from the following sources
  - The cloudy bow shock models from [[file:cloudy-bow-shock.org]]
    - for the stellar spectrum and abundances
  - The 2013 Helix models from file:/Users/will/Work/PNe/Peter/herschel-helix-models/models/
    - For details of the PDR physics and chemistry
  - The Raman scattering project from [[file:../../dib-scatter-hii/doc/absorption-6634.org][file:~/Dropbox/dib-scatter-hii/doc/absorption-6634.org]]
    - For other details relevant to PDR models



*** Specific models
- For the bow shock models, we used n = 10, but the [S II] density is much higher than this
  - So, we will try initial densities of n = 100 and n = 1000
- It is likely that various stars are illuminating the filaments, but to start with we will just use W03 for simplicity
  
**** First model: n = 100, constant pressure
- This should be a good guess for a minimum viable model
- Stopping criterion will be based on H column density
  - Take 3e21 to start with
  - [X] Also, we can try stopping in zone 1 just to make sure everything is working
    - That worked after I copied the SED files over
    - Now for the real thing

**** Second model: same but go deeper in to the cloud
- The previous model stopped at log N = 21.5, so we will try 22, which is 3 times deeper
- This might stand a chance of getting to the fully molecular zone
  - although it seems that the nir lines and by extension the optical lines too have peaks that are where the molecular fraction is still small

**** Other possible models
- The above models all use the default magnetic equation of state of \Gamma_m = 4/3
  - As a result, they get magnetically dominated in the PDR, so that the total density increase is only a factor of 10 or so
- We could try using constant Alfven speed (\Gamma = 1/2), or even parallel field (\Gamma = 0)

**** Physical parameters
+ We will try constant density to start with
  + Start with 100 pcc, but could be higher
  + /But leave this to the specific models/
+ Projected separation is 10 to 30 arcsec. Taking compromise of 20
  + 20 arcsec = 6 pc = 1.85e+19 cm
  + 19.27 on log scale
+ Magnetic field
  + Assume Alfven speed of 3 km/s
  + B / (4 pi \rho)^{1/2} = 3 km/s
  + B = 3 1.0e5 sqrt(4 pi 100 2e-24) = 1.5e-5 G
    + -4.82 on log10 scale
  + For some reason, I seem to be using a smaller magnetic field in the actual models above, must be 1 km/s for v_A
+ Abundances are largely from Valerdi:2019a
+ *NEW* Changes from the bow shock models
  + Larger inner radius
  + Larger density
  + Use the big H2 molecule
  + Stopping criterion, but this is set in the individual models

**** Save files
+ Unlike the bow shock models, we do need to get various PDR quantities
  - Particularly those related to H2
+ [2024-01-26 Fri] Update: added some of the optical H2 lines
  + 9029.26A, 4-1 Q(1)
    - one of the strongest optical lines
  + 6636.69A, 5-1 S(7)
    - the best one around H alpha
  + 6261.73A, 12-5 S(1)
    + the most reliable of the high-J lines
+ Also added the far-red [C I] lines for good measure
  - plus strongest of the O I fluorescent lines at 8446.36A, although I should really make a blend for it since there are three closely spaced components
