+ The Giant Raman Wing Star
  + 0:59:05.1826 -72:10:35.340
  + This is mYSO-C in Rubio:2018a
    + A_V = 2.5 +/- 1
    + log T_eff / K = 4.5 +0.1 -0.2
    + log L / L_sun = 5.1 \pm 0.25
    + Mass = 26 \pm 5 M_sun
    + Log Age / yr = 4.25 \pm 1.0
    + Class I (massive protostellar disk)
    + 20 times brighter than any other source in O I 8446
+ The central globule star
  + That is, center of the MUSE field
  + SSN 17
  + 0:59:02.9347 -72:10:34.976
  + It has a mini star cluster around it (Sc 2)
  + This has no low ionization line emission
  + The star must be in front of the globule, possibly far from it
  + Evidence for some [Fe III] emission, possibly jet source
+ The Sc 1 globule star
  + 0:59:05.9596 -72:10:30.145
  + Star is 1 arcsec south of SSN 62 (O9V), which is probably unrelated foreground
  + Globule is just 3 arcsec north of W 2 (O8.5III), which is brightest star in central cluster
  + Bright O I 8446 centered on star, which is at head of globule
    + Also cometary tail-like extension along tail of globule
  + Based on Ha brightness around the edge, globule seems ionized principally from South (by W 2) but also to a lesser extent from the West (similar to the fainter globules to south of Sc 1)
+ The East globule star
  + The globule that is just north of the bow shock
    + Along the chain of filaments
  + 0:58:59.7724 -72:10:16.596
  + Very bright in O I 8446, second only to mYSO-C
+ The Sc 5 globule
  + 0:59:00.4173 -72:10:04.941
  + This has the highest density ionized gas apart from the globule around mYSO-C
  + Is it ionized by a nearby O star?
  + Or is it just at a similar z-position to one of the bright ones, such as W2 or W1?
    + Seems to be pointing more closely at W2
  + Double source in O I
+ The Sc 4 globule
  + 0:59:02.5807 -72:10:07.095
  + Tiny globule with star in its tip
  + Bright unresolved source in O I 8446
+ South East Foreground globule star A
  + Two stellar sources with very different line emission spectra
    + The one to E is more central on the globule (but may just be projected)
    + The one to the W is resolved in O I 8446 and is strong in [S II] but not [O I]
+ South East Foreground globule star B
  + Just visible on bottom edge of MUSE field
  + 0:59:08.5152 -72:11:03.105
  + Projected on or inside a high extinction globule
  + Bright in O I 8446
+ South foreground ridge star
  + 0:59:02.0775 -72:11:02.425

** Deep neutral/molecular lines

*** Possible molecular candidates
- Diffuse clouds are known to show optical/IR absorption in lines of CN, C_2, CH, CH+, NH, C_3
  - See Table 2 of Snow:2006e ARAA review
- Emission lines are only seen in comets and the Red Rectangle



**** Molecular line databases
- ExoMol
  - https://www.exomol.com
  - This has OH+ lines
    - See Wang:2020g
**** How to calculate wavelengths
- We can use the data from Huber & Herzberg (1979) for calculating the transition energies
  - Earlier version in Appendix of Herzberg (1950)
- The equations to use are in Chapter III of Herzberg (1950)
  #+begin_example
    From the data of Table.39, the positions of the rotational and vibrational levels in any of the electronic states may be derived with the aid of the formulae (III, 116) and (III, 121) or, for multiplet states, of the formulae given in Chapter V. The same data may also be used for a calculation of the potential curves either using the Morse function (III, 98) or more involved functions (see p. 102). Furthermore, from these data the positions of the bands and of the lines within the bands may be derived according to the formulae developed in Chapters III, IV, and V. For the wavelengths of the observed bands of the various molecules, the reader is referred to the extensive tables of Pearse and Gaydon (47).

**** OH lines
- These are a major component of the night sky airglow spectrum
  - Osterbrock:1996a, Osterbrock:1997a
- But SMC is at sufficiently high velocity (+160) that any emission from the nebula should be shifted away from the sky line
- I looked at the
**** Molecular ions
- CH+ is detected by mm emission lines in Orion Bar
  - Nagy:2013a
  - Could it have optical/ir lines too?
- OH- 
**** C_2 lines
- There is the (2-0) band at 8751, but these are very weak and narrow  when seen in absorption, and are separated by 2 to 4 Angstrom

**** CN lines

- Some in violet, some in IR, but also in far red
- Best recent paper is Syme:2021y
- Seems there is a band that peaks in the Red
  - Lines at 9124.0, 9127.4, seem to close together
*** 6400 to 6800 Angstrom
- These are in the same range as the Ha Raman wings
- 6626.5
  - Most clearly molecular by its distribution. The filaments are very sharp
- 6635.5, 6644.5, 6654.5
  - These could be neutral or low ionization, given their distribution
- 6698
  - Weak and moderately diffuse
  - Probably medium ionization
- 6527.5
  - Look like medium ionization
- 6501, 6484.5 (weak)
  - Probably low ionization
- 6458
  - Possibly neutral but weak
- 6594.5 absorption
  - This is seen best in the diffuse Raman zone in the NW
  - It is very broad (10 Angstrom) and a very smooth parabola shape in the summed spectrum

** Details of Raman profiles
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       BA4EBC34-BC84-46ED-90D9-4C4C44EDAC98
:END:
- Most of this is in the globule around mYSO-C
  - All the other emission (for example, from the filaments) is very weak
*** Extent of flat top to profile
- This should tell us the wavelength where the profile becomes optically thin
*** Absorption lines

**** The O I lines

**** The Si II line

**** The He II lines
- In the Ha profile, we see absorption at 6545, which may well be the Raman scattered counterpart of He II 1025.272, which is just to the blue of H I 1025.722
- This line is seen in emission in the PNe NGC 6888 and NGC 6881
  - Choi:2020c




** General points about the globules and filaments
- The background globules show bright heads and less bright flanks
  - This is evidence for the local anisotropy of the radiation field
  - And that the tail axis is aligned with the radiation
  - Suggesting that the globules have been sculpted to some extent (unless it is simply chance)
- The foreground ridge, on the other hand, does not look like this
  - It seems more to be illuminated from the side
** Lines of interest
+ Still to do:
  + [O I] 6300, 6363
  + [S III] 6312, 9069
  + O I 8446
  + [Cl IV] 8045
  + [C I] 8727

** A possible high-ionization bow shock around Walborn 3
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ Seen in He II 4686 and [Ar IV]
+ Also visible in [O III]
+ Radius is about 4 arcsec = 1 pc
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210602-085328.png]]
*** Lines to use for the bow shock
+ [X] He II 4685.71
  + 3-4 transition, so equivalent to Paschen \alpha
+ Lots of [Ar IV] lines!
  + [X] [Ar IV] 4740
  + [-] [Ar IV] 4711
    + Can give density diagnostic *but* it is blended with He I 4713
    + We can try and de-blend it using other helium lines
    + And it looks like the the He I contribution is small
  + [X] [Ar IV] red lines
    + 7170.5 and 7262.7 are clearly detected
      + But not 7237.4 strangely
      + Possibly because of contamination with C II
    + We can calculate a temperature from this!
      + See [[id:8B4C1164-B47D-47BE-9012-7DD0B661E014][[Ar IV] density and T indicators]]
    + Theory of [Ar IV] lines
      + (Ne, Te) diagnostic diagrams given in 
+ [Cl IV] 7530.8 and 8046.3
  + Unfortunately, the ratio gives us nothing since they come from the same upper state (S/N is not good enough to give useful reddening)
  + The auroral line is 5322.99 but it is not detected
  + [X] 7530.8 done, but contaminated by C II 7530.57
    + This is seen in the map, which shows emission from the filaments and clumps
    + The C II emission seems to come from much closer to the ionization front than it does in Orion
    + This is probably an ionization effect - the C^+ column in the ionized gas is much smaller because the spectrum is harder
    + But may also be a contribution of the low metallicity
  + [X] 8046.3
    + Also contaminated
+ He I 4713 - see above
+ [X] Look for other He I lines
  + [X] He I 4921.93
  + He I 5015.68 - on wing of 5007 but not excessively blended
  + [X] He I 5047.74 - weak
  + [X] Use PyNeb to find lines (or combinations of lines) that should be a fixed ratio to 4713, so that we can subtract it.
+ [X] Look for other He II lines
  + *none are usable* Or maybe they are
  + 4859.319 (4-8 Br \delta) - completely swamped by H\beta
  + 5411.52 (4-7 Br \gamma), which coincides with [Fe III]. Although that should not be a problem because there is no [Fe III] from the bow shock region (see below)
    + But it shows no emission - just photospheric absorption 
  + 6560.1 (4-6 Br \beta)
    + Probably too blended with H\alpha
+ [X] [Ar III] 5193.69
  - very weak and diffuse
  - does not seem to show any peak at the bow shock
  - T indicator with red [Ar III] line
+ [X] [Ar III] 7135.78
+ [X] H\alpha and H\beta to get reddening
  + [X] Extract line maps
  + [X] Fine correction for zero point offset
  + [X] Calculate reddening
    + We have a reddening map [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/data/ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits][ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits]]
    + Average reddening of bow shock region is E(B-V) = 0.087
    + We have a SMC reddening curve that we calculate from pyneb using parameters from Gordon:2003l
    + I am ignoring the stellar absorption EW for now, but that needs to be dealt with if we ever look at more reddened regions. 
+ [X] [S III] lines for temperature
+ [X] [Cl III] lines for density
  + These are rubbish, unfortunately.  Signal-to-noise is too low to say anything at all
+ [ ] [S II] lines for density
  + This works much better - s/n is high and we are clearly away from the low-density limit
  + We can distinguish the denser gas close to ionization fronts on filaments from the lower-density diffuse component
    + The latter has densities of order 
**** Lines that that do NOT come from bow shock
+ [Fe III] 4987.20 - has broad range of emission, but concentrated in the E of the field
+ [Fe III] 4658.1 - weaker than 4987, but similar distribution
  + Except for the mYSO, where it is super-bright
+ Lots of other [Fe III] and [Fe II] lines that only show up in the mYSO
+ Si II 5041.03 - mYSO and SE clump (which may be another mYSO)
+ [N I] 5200 comes from filaments and clumps, but not from ionized gas
+

:END:
+ The projected area around W 3 shows
  + small arc in He II
  + larger but still centrally-concentrated arc in [Ar IV]
  + no particular concentration in [O III], He I, [Ar III], H I, etc
+ This suggests that the ionizing illumination is dominated by W 3 for E > 40.735 eV
  + But it does not dominate the illumination for E = 35 \to 40.735 eV or any of the softer bands
+ From the ACS H\alpha image, there is small region that shows the bow shell cleanly
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210614-130218.png]]
  Between about 3 and 7 arcsec from W3.  Beyond this, the globules start to dominate the H alpha and other medium ionization lines
***** Ionization balance of Ar
+ We should have
  \[
  \frac{Ar^{3+}}{Ar^{2+}} =
  \frac{F \sigma}{\alpha n_e}
  \]
  + F is the ionizing flux for h\nu > 40.7 eV
  + \sigma is the Ar^{2+} photoionization cross section
  + \alpha is the Ar^{3+} recombination rate
+ Assume constant T and that F only varies by geometrical dilution: F ~ 1/R^2

  | 4711.37 |  85 |
  | 4740.17 |  60 |
  |  7170.5 |   3 |
  |  7237.4 | 3.5 |
  |  7262.7 | 2.5 |
+ According to ratios specified by Keenan:
  + R_1 = 4711.37 /  4740.17 = 1.417 -> 0.1513 on log scale
    + This is low-density limit
    + In principle there may be some contamination by He I
      + But even if the density is high as 200 or so, there is hardly any effect on the temperature diagnostics
  + R_2 = 7238 / (4711 + 4730) = 3.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.02414 -> -1.617
    + implies T a bit bigger than 20,000 K !!!
    + *this one is bad* it is contaminated by C II 7236.19 or something
      + The map shows that most of the emission comes from the filament not from the bow shock
  + R_3 = 7263 / (4711 + 4730) =  2.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.01724 -> -1.763
    + gives T = 17500 K, approx
  + R_4 = 7171 / (4711 + 4730) = 3 / (60 + 85) = 0.02069 -> -1.684
    + but theoretically R_4 / R_2 = 1.33
    + We find R_4/R_2 = 7171 / 7238 = 3 / 3.5 = 0.8571, which must be due to contamination of 7238
    + So assuming R_2 = R_4 / 1.33, then R_2 = 0.02069 / 1.33 = 0.01556 -> -1.808
      + gives 17500 K, same as R_3
  + *Conclusion* Both R_3 and R_4 imply 17,500 K, while R_2 is hopelessly contaminated
  + *Except* I have not included the reddening

*** Stellar parameters of W 3
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
+ Rivero-Gonzalez:2012w
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-223450.png]]
+ T_eff = 55000 K or 51000 K with an alternative solution
+ Wind parameters:
  + Mdot = 2.5e-6 Msun/yr
    + I no longer have faith in this value.
    + Supposedly it is from the Ha and He II 4686 lines, but these are not well produced by the Fastwind models.
      + The model predicts emission in the wings of the He II line, which is not seen at all
        [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-122838.png]]
      + Green is the observations.  Red, blue, black is different T_eff models. Red is supposedly the average of blue (cooler) and black (hotter), so it is odd that it does not lie between them.
      + Also the POWR models give He II 4686 emission for the high mass-loss case (SMC-OB-III grid)
    + Observed He II line from W3 from MUSE:
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130804.png]]
    + Same for W1 (O4 If+)
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130853.png]]
    + So W1 has clear wind signature in the He II line
      + A velocity of 2000 km/s is \Delta\lambda = 31 \AA at 4686
      + The wings go from 4667 to 4710 -> +/- 20 \AA -> +/- 1280 km/s
    + [X] But note that they both have broad bumps in the wings of the H\beta line
      + *I now think these are not real*
        + I looked at the original spectra, and I think it is more likely to be a broad absorption feature around 4750 that has thrown off the continuum fit
        + Orion stars show the same, see Simon-Diaz paper
        + Might be some broad DIB
      + These don't seem to be predicted by any of the atmosphere models
      + /Could they be Raman scattering?/
        + No I don't think so
      + 4809 to 4919 \AA in H\beta -> +/- 55 \AA -> +/- 3000 km/s
      + Seems a bit excessive to be a velocity
  + Vw = 2800 km/s
  + Ram pressure at 1 pc
    + \rho V^2 = Mdot V / 4 \pi R^2
    + => = 3.687e-10 dyne / cm^2
    + P_ram / k = 2.67e6
    + **Lower Mdot value** Mdot = 2.2e-7 from Q_2 fitting of POWR models
      + Also, use R = 1.2 pc
      + P_ram = 2.2e-7 1.989e33 2800 1.0e5 / 3.15576e7 4 pi 1.2**2 3.085677582e18**2 = 2.253e-11 dyne / cm^2
      + P_ram / k = 1.632e+05
  + [2022-07-24 Sun] New measurements of wind parameters from Rickard:2022z
    + These agree with the values I got from the POWR models
  + Compare with thermal pressure of H II gas
    + P_gas / k = n_H (1 + y + 1 + 1.5 y)  T
      + Assuming x++ = 0.5
      + Also, ne = (1 + 1.5 y) n_H
        + y = 0.0824
        + P / k = ne T (2 + 2.5 y) / (1 + 1.5 y) = 1.963 ne T
      + Assume T = 13500 K
      + n = 1.632e+05 / 1.963 13500 = 6.2 pcc
    + Best estimate now is about n = 14 pcc from He II measurements
    + **Conclusions** We want a mass loss rate of about 5e-7 for ram pressure balance to work
      + This is slightly higher than we got from the He II analysis, but much less than the 2e-6 from before
  + We could also have a ram pressure component, so multiply by 1 + M^2
    + We can't have M much larger than 1, otherwise the density would have to be too low
    + And this makes no sense anyway, since the density measurement is for the inner rim, which must be static
+ Momentum efficiency of the wind:
  + Assume log L = 5.98
    + Radiation pressure at shell: P_rad = L / c 4 pi R^2 = 7.063e-10 dyne / cm^2
    + But only a fraction of this is trapped by shell
      + We estimate \tau_{abs} = 0.01 from infrared luminosity
      + And this gets multiplied by Q_P / Q_{abs} ~= 1.2
      + So the absorbed radiation pressure is 8.476e-12
        + => P/k = 6.139e+04
        + => n = 2.32 pcc
  + This means that the radiation support is not completely negligible
    + It amounts to about 20% of the total pressure
**** Atmosphere models for W3
+ The POWR OB models only go up to 50,000 K
  + This is just about acceptable if we take the lower T solution from Rivero-Gonzalez
+ There are 3 sets of SMC O star models with different wind strengths
+ I am first looking at the intermediate set
+ Model parameters for 50-42 (Teff = 50 kK, log g = 4.2)

*** Photospheric absorption lines from W3
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ We might be able to get a radial velocity
  + (assuming it is not a binary)
+ There is an absorption line around 4740, which in most stars is to the red of the [Ar IV] emission line
  + But in W3 it is to the blue
  + So if it is the same line, this suggests a large negative radial velocity
  + But I need to check other lines.  It would be odd for nobody to have noticed this before
+ The He II 4686 line and H\beta 4881 look better
  + These show W3 is not special
  + And most stars are blue-shifted with respect to the gas
  + Although this is assuming that the lines are symmetrical, which may not be the case if they are affected by the stellar wind
+ [X] Or we could look at red lines - the wavelength resolution is better there
  + But the lines are weaker
  + For the hot stars, we have the narrow line N IV 6380, which could give a precise velocity
+ [ ] Castro:2018a use the He II 5411.5 line to measure the radial velocities
  + Yes, this looks the best line
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210620-144147.png]]
    This shows the profiles of several bright stars.  The thick yellow one is W 3.  It is considerably more blue-shifted than the others.
  + We should modify the moment calculations to work with the ~contdiv~ files and determine EW and mean velocity (and sigma, and skewness ...)
*** Relevant papers on bow shocks in SMC
+ Gvaramadze:2011b
  - Massive runaway stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud
  - Detects several bow shocks in 24 micron emission
  - One is just SW of NGC 346, but it came from somewhere else
  - Sizes are 3 to 30 arcsec
    + 1 to 10 pc
+ Sheets:2013v
  - DUSTY OB STARS IN THE SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD. I. OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY REVEALS PREDOMINANTLY MAIN-SEQUENCE OB STARS
+ Adams:2013a
  - DUSTY OB STARS IN THE SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD. II. EXTRAGALACTIC DISKS OR EXAMPLES OF THE PLEIADES PHENOMENON?
  - Has an "interacting hotspot model" that seems to be very similar to a dust wave
*** Possible runway of W3
- Look at the stellar radial velocity in more detail
  - Although the possibility of binarity means this cannot be relied upon
- What about transverse motions?
  - If W3 was ejected from the core of the cluster, then it has moved about 6 pc to the west, which is in the right direction to form the bow shock
  - Assuming an age of about 2 million years, then this gives a velocity of
    - 6 pc / 2e6 yr km
    - 6 3.085677582e18 / 2e6 3.15576e7 1.0e5 = 3 km/s
  - This is very slow and would not produce a supersonic bow shock
- The internal velocity dispersion within the nebula is larger than this
  - 6 km/s sigma(POS) from Javier paper
  - 9 km/s sigma(LOS) from
*** The SNR to the E of the nebula
- Names: SNR J0059.4−7210, B0057-72.2, DEM S103, IKT 18
- Matsuura:2022v have a possible detection of 24 micron emission from the SNR
  - This is much weaker than the emission from the bow shock
- Maggi:2019q have x rays from the SNR, which show a nice circular morphology.  They do not see any significant diffuse x rays from the H II region

+ But He II is redder: +157 +/- 2
  + But the difference may not be significant
*** Velocity patterns in the nebula
- In low ionization lines, there is a clear N-S gradient
  - In the S, the foreground filaments are blueshifted: V = 150
  - In the N, the background globules are redshifted: V = 170
- In the ionized lines, the variation is much less: 160 to 165 approx in Ha
  - There is a flip in behavior between the N and S half of field
  - In both halves, the ionized velocity variation tracks the sii velocity
    - But in the S half, the ionized velocity is redshifted from sii
    - Whereas in N half it is blueshifted from sii
- So on the one hand, this looks like a sort of Hubble flow, as in a PN, with expansion speed increasing with radius
  - although it is not spherical since we see it varying on the plane of the sky
- But on the other hand, we could interpret it as that the neutral globules are accelerated by the rocket effect, and then the photoevaporation flows largely undo that for the ionized  gas by flowing inwards in the frame of the i front

    + Greissen:2002a say that
      : CDELTi and CROTAi are allowed to coexist with CDi_j as an aid to old FITS interpreters, but are to be ignored by new readers.
    + Which means that the CROTA2 is being ignored?
+ When I fixed the ~CRPIX~ and ~CRVAL~ it also made a rotation, which seems wrong

+ Where are the infrared images stored?
**** Spitzer IRS spectra
+ There are loads of these, with slits that seem to go across the bow shock
+ I have downloaded a bunch of spectra
  + [[file:../big-data/spitzer/tgt-108-selected_Post_BCDs/]]
  + (Not in the git repo)
+ The table of observations is also saved:

  + This is in IPAC format
+ These might be useful for a follow up project
+ But it looks tricky to analyse the data
  + I tried installing Cubism, but it is not compatible with macos 11
**** Dust opacity spectra
+ We need these in order to plot spectrum of modified black-body: \(\kappa_\lambda B_\lambda\)
+ Since currently, we are just using a \beta law, which is fine in the far-infrared but not in mid-infrared
  + But is it really worth it?
+ We can follow the same approach as in [[id:D71FC23A-3AE0-4603-8305-D7F6B7244A71][Effects of rotational disruption of large grains]] in the dust-wave project

*** Analysis of bow shock density, etc

**** He II lines
+ I have already tried to do this analysis in notebook 01-02:
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.py]]
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.ipynb]]
+ But I was getting inconsistent results, so I am going to start again
+ I had used a few different approaches:
  1. (Comes second in the notebook). Use the total He II luminosity to derive the ionizing photon rate Q_2.  The only assumption here is that all the He II emission comes from recombination (in photoionization equilibrium).
     - We find a flux of 2.04e-15 erg/s/cm^2
     - This corresponds to a luminosity of 9.28e32 erg/s = 0.242 Lsun
     - PyNeb is used to get emissivity of 4686 and \alpha_B(He^++)
       - but I had assumed T = 18000 and 12000
       - Switched this now to 12500, 15500 as more representative of measured values
     - This gives Q_2 = \alpha_B(He^++) L(4686) / e(4686) (\Omega / 4\pi)
       - Q_2 = (2.8 +/- 0.1)e45
     - This can be compared with stellar atmosphere models
       - See [[id:262D3FA1-80BD-4225-BE22-7970BD1FF6FF][Rearrange and rescale the models]] in this file. 
  2. (First in notebook).  Use peak He II brightness to estimate the electron density
  3. (Not in notebook, but see [[id:CC0FB6FC-FE95-4F68-B4F4-6CD1096297A2][Consistency check on the ionization fraction and thickness of the He II zone]] in this file). Estimate the thickness of the He++ zone. 


**** Ionization state based upon multiple lines
From the analysis of the



**** Other diagnostics
- We have the [Cl IV] lines
  - 7530.8
    - This is well detected, peak is about 7 over BG of about 1
  - 8045.62 
    - Wavelength from NIST but Atomic Line List has 8046.3
    - Blended with low ionization, but recoverable
    - Peak is about 15 over BG of 1
    - Maybe 7531/8046 is density sensitive?
      - *no* it should be 0.286 always
      - I measure 7/13 = 0.538, which seems rather high
  - 5323.2 auroral line
    - Wavelength is from Young:2011b
    - ALL has 5322.99
    - Very weak, but maybe detected with peak of about 1
- We can use the [Fe III] density from 4986/4658
  - Mabel did this for the entire nebula, getting about unity => n = 100 +/- 20
  - The lines are very weak, but it looks to me like we have 4986/4658 = 2, implying a lower density
    - That is in the E of nebula, it is more like unity around the bow shock area
- We also have the [Fe III] 5270 line, which can possibly be used as  T indicator
- Strangely, the [Fe III] lines are stronger in the NE and S edge than in the NW region
**** New lines
- UNIDENTIFIED at 8660 approx
  - There are a few N I lines around here, but this seems different
  - Aha, it is one of the unidentified lines from the Tarantula cubes too
  - Look for more of these lines
    - 8151 is there - very strong in the filaments
      - [Fe I] 8151.3424 
    - Si I 8035 clearly detected in filaments, but not in YSO
      - But now I think 8039 is the wavelength, so probably not Si I
      - Note that 30 Dor has a line around here, but it is clearly ionized
    - *Have these filaments had a SNR pass through them?*
    - Line at 8047 from filaments that blends with [Cl IV] 8046
      - perhaps 8038 is from same multiplet, in which case it can be removed
      - In 30 Dor there is no sign of this line at all
    - More from the 7800-8200 range
      - 7802, 7838, 7891, 7959, 7997 weak, 8009, 8039, 8069 super weak, 8083, 8151 strong, 8193 weak
      - Fourth one could be [Fe I] 7959.0029 
        - 3d6.4s2-3d7.(4F).4s a5D-a3F  4 - 3
        - Same multiplet as 8151 (2-2) and 7709 (4-2)
        - But why is 7964 (3-2) missing?
    - Comparison with 30 Dor
      - The 8083 line seems there, BUT at 8083.5 and it traces ionized gas
        - It is next to a much stronger sky line
      - Another line at 8034.5 (observed 8041.24) is also ionized and might correspond to the 8039 line, but the wavelength does not seem right
      - 8009 (observed 8016) has a sky line right on top (how come this was not an issue for NGC 346?)
      - 7999 is strong in PDR in 30 Dor but we only see it in YSO in NGC 346
    - 6750-7800
      - 7463.5, 7238.5,
        - Second one might be [V I] 7238.64
        - First one might be [Ni I] 7464.367 except wavelength is not close enough
      - very weak: 7195, 7179, 7144, 7111, 7106
        - Second one could be Fe I 7179.9948
          - 3d7.(4F).4s-3d6.(5D).4s.4p.(3Po)
          - a3F-z5Do
          - 4 - 4
          - A = 8.463e+02 /s, which is largest for its multiplet
      - 7092.5, 7057.5 very weak
      - 7044
        - not a deep neutral line, but a very weird distribution
      - 7039 very weak
        - looks like a neutral fluorescence line
      - 7011 very weak
      - 7002 very weak except for YSO
        - clearly is O I 7001.92
      - 7791, 7782, 7768, 7741 weak
      - 7663, 7637 weak, 7628 weak
        - these look slightly more diffuse than the other lines, maybe
      - 7527 weak, 7488.5 weak
        - also diffuse
      - 7468.5, 7442 very weak, 7254
        - Clearly these are
          - N I 7468.31, 7442.30
          - O I 7254.15
        - Distribution much smoother than the other lines
        - Bright from mYSO-C and from Raman clump
      - 7707 weak
        - This is close to Fe I 7708.8389, which is same multiplet as 8151
        - /Is this the same line?/ It is off by nearly 2 angstrom
        - *It turns out I was using the wrong velocity*
          - Should be +160 for the BG filaments or 150 for the foreground ones
    - 6000 to 6530
      - 6503 very weak
      - 6460 very weak
        - This is certainly not C II 6462, which is perhaps detected from the bow shock region, but is even weaker
      - 6451.5 weak, 6448 very weak
      - 6434 very weak
      - 6371.5 ionized
        - probably Si II 6371.36
      - 6347
        - likely to be Si II 6347.11
        - Note that this looks like Si II 5978.93 and 5957.56 in its spatial distribution
      - 6270.3 very weak
      - 6221.6 very weak
      - 6084.2 weakest ever
      - 6046 also very weak
        - clearly is O I 6046.23
      - 6038 extremely weak
      - 5979, 5958 weak
        - Clearly Si II 5978.93 and 5957.56
      - 5740 very weak
        - Probably Si III 5739.73
        - Only seen in *bow shock area*, to W of W 3
      - 5577 badly affected by sky
        - But we can just about detect the redshifted [O I] line from the nebula, especially in the globules just south of W 2
      - 5412 He II emission from inside edge of bow shock, but affected by stellar absorption
  - YSO only
    - 7999 (maybe [Fe II] 7999.47) maybe also from jet (?) in globule
    - 8107, 8111, 8115 (maybe seen in Orion)
    - 8126 maybe Ca I 8125.31
      - seen faintly in 3 globules in addition to YSO, including one of the foreground globules
    - 8188
      - observed in Orion but unidentified?
      - also seen in lower globule (different one from above)
    - 7468.5 similar to 8188, likely to be N I 7468.3
    - 7452 probably [Fe II] 7452.54
    - 7442 probably N I 7442.30
    - 7412 probably [Ni II] 7411.61
    - 7378 probably [Ni II] 7377.83
    - 7172 probably [Fe II] 7172.00
- Si II 5041
  - This is very weak
  - But with a strange clump in the bottom left corner
    - Just north of the star at 0:59:08.5822 -72:10:57.667
- At about 7262 angstrom
  - No, of course this is Ar IV 7263
- At about 7500
  - He I 7499.85
  - But it seems more bow shock-y than the other He I lines
- Cl IV 7531 looks pretty strong
- Cl IV 8046 is contaminated, but it could be removed, perhaps by N I
- [K IV] 6101.79 ( ^3P_2 - ^1D_2 )
  - Weaker than the [Ar IV] lines, but definitely detected from the bow shock
  - There is another line of same multiplet at 6795.1 that we should look for
    - ^3P_1 - ^1D_2
    - Strangely, we do not seem to have a continuum-subtracted cube that covers this wavelength. The Ha raman wing section stops at 6800
    - Now we have it, and the line is detected, but it is very weak
    - Weaker than 6101.79 by a factor of 4 *as expected*
  - This is isoelectronic to [Ar III]
    - Equivalent lines are 7135.8 and 7751.1
    - Of which the redder one is also 4 times weaker (unlike what I first thought)


**** TODO Find the K+++ / Ar+++ ratio
- This can come from the [K IV] lines
- We could also do the Cl+++ abundance form the [Cl IV] lines
  - Best to use 7531 even though it is weaker than 8046 because it is less blended with low ionization lines


**** What is origin of second peak in [Ar IV]?
- This is centered on 0:59:07.3344,-72:10:48.188 in the lower left of the field
- The only O star there is MPG 500, which is classified as O6V
  - That does not seem to be hot enough to generate much [Ar IV]
  - On the other hand, Orion has some [Ar IV] emission, so it could be that
  - Alternatively, it could be related to the SNR to the East
**** Density and/or dust opacity from the infrared emission
+ From section 2 of Paper III
  + \Sigma = \tau / \kappa
  + \rho = \Sigma / h = \tau / \kappa h = n m
+ We have
  + \tau = 0.01
  + \kappa = 600 \kappa_600 cm^2/g
  + h = H R = 1.2 H pc
  + m = 2e-24 g
+ This gives us
  + n = \tau / \kappa h m = 0.01 / 600 \kappa_600 H 1.2 3.085677582e18 2e-24
  + => n = 2.251 / \kappa_600 H
+ So with H = 1, and using the He II determination of 13 pcc for n
  + => \kappa_600 = 2.251 / 13 = 0.173
  + => \kappa = 104 cm^2 / g
  + This seems reasonable for a SMC metallicity
+ We can convert this to a \sigma per H
  + \sigma = 2.1e-20 cm^2 / H


** General thoughts
+ Properties of N66 from Lopez:2014a
  + Q(H) = 4e50 /s = 40 x Orion
  + n = 100 pcc = 0.03 x Orion
    + In both cases there are large variations, however
  + R = 64 pc = 30 x Orion
  + *therefore* (n R) and (Q n) are both similar to Orion, so ionization parameter is similar too
*** Comparison of size scales and luminosities between Orion and SMC
+ SMC distance: 61.7 kpc
  + Distance modulus: 5 log10(D/10 pc) = 18.95
  + The brightest star in the vicinity of source C is V = 15
    + => M_V = 15 - 18.95 = -3.95
    + This is only 0.5 mag brighter than th1C, so probably O6V
  + Sun has M_V = +4.81 => V = 23.76

*** Ionizing stars in N66

**** Contribution of the WR+WR binary HD 5980
+ Considerable variation over last 20 years
+ *Conclusions*
  + For the low state, we have Q_0 = 1e50 approx
  + And a very low Q_2 (so no ionizing to He II)
+ High state (1994):
  + log L = 6.6
  + T_* = 47 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 111e-5
  + Vinf = 750 km/s
  + R_10 = 28 Rsun
+ Low state (2014):
  + log L = 6.23
  + T_* = 48 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 14e-5
  + Vinf = 2100 km/s
  + R_10 = 19 Rsun
+ Transformation for POWR models
  - All their models are for nominal log L = 5.3
  - They use a transformed radius: R_t = R_* (V_inf / 2500 km/s)^{2/3} (Mdot sqrt(D) / 1e-4)^{-2/3}
    - where D = 1/f is clumping factor
  - For a different luminosity, we must rescale R_* as L^{1/2}
  - And Mdot scales as L^{3/4}
  - So we have:
    - High state:
      - R_* = 28 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.6)) = 6.268 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((750/2500)/ (11.1))**(2/3) = 0.09 6.268 = 0.56412 Rsun => -0.248 on log10 scale
        - Unfortunately, that is off the bottom of the grid!
    - Low state:
      - Luminosity is 10**(6.23 - 5.3) = 8.5 times higher than fiducial
      - R_* = 19 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.23)) = 6.513 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((2100/2500)/ (1.4))**(2/3) = 0.7114 6.513 = 4.633 Rsun => 0.6659 on log 10 scale
+ So for the low state, the closest model is 06-14: T = 44.7 kK, log Rt = 0.7
  + This comes with R_* = 7.5 => rescaled: 7.5 sqrt(8.5) = 21.9 Rsun
    + (close enough to 19)
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.01, 47.69, 0.00, 45.77 - so very soft
    + Rescaled back to real luminosity: Q_0 = 49.01 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 49.94
  + Mdot = -4.23 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.23) = 2.93e-4
    + this is not entirely consistent with the original 1.4e-4
  + V = 1600 km/s
+ We should also look at the closest hotter model 07-13: T = 50000 K, log Rt = 0.8
  + R_* = 5.9 => rescaled: 5.9 sqrt(8.5) = 17 Rsun
    + So this model and the previous one nicely bracket 19 Rsun
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.09, 48.47, 36.46, 47.42 - so not so soft, but still almost no He+ ionizing radiation
    + Rescaled ionizing luminosity: 49.09 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 50.02
  + Mdot = -4.53 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.53) = 1.47e-4
    + Very close to original

+ M_bol = V + BC - AV - DM
  + DM = 18.95
  + AV = 0.3 approx (assuming E(B-V) = 0.1)
  + I have added an extra 1 mag extinction by hand to SSN 168
+ L/Lsun = 10**(0.4 (M_sun - M_bol))
  + M_sun = 4.73
+ R = sqrt(L / 4 \pi \sigma T^4)
+ So in terms of bolometric flux, the nearby B star totally dominates
+ But we should work out the external luminosity incident on the globule
  + And not include SSN 168 since that is on the inside
  + Sum over stars of luminosity x area covering fraction: \sum_i L_i \Omega_i / 4\pi
  + \Omega_i / 4\pi = A_glob / 4\pi d^2 = \pi r_glob^2 / 4\pi d^2 = r_glob^2 / 4 d^2
  + Take r_glob = 1 arcsec
+ The result is a total of 1.3e4 Lsun, of which half comes from W 2
+ So this is less than the inner luminosity from SSN 168 (3e4), if that was all trapped
  + Also, the external luminosities are upper limits, assuming that everything is in the plane of the sky
+ I have done the same for the ionizing luminosity
  + I get a total external incident luminosity of Q_ext = 6.3e47 s^-1
  + As opposed to an internal luminosity from the B0V star of 4e47 s^-1
  + The external incident luminosity is split up as follows
    + 40% from W 2
    + 24% from W 1
    + 17% from SSN 22
    + 6% from W 3
    + 13% from the rest (each 3% or less)
+ [ ] Now, we need to compare this with the Ha luminosity of the globule and of the inner sources
***** Relative contributions to the global ionization balance
+ The list above has all the stars with Q_0 > 5e48 I think
  + Except for some more that a long way to S or N
+ Total luminosity is 4.3e50
  + Could be 5.3e50 if we add in both WR stars as equals
  + Lopez:2014a give 50.6 -> 4e50
    + This is based on a simple conversion of the H\alpha luminosity of log L(Ha) = 38.6
    + [ ] We should compare that with the flux measured in our MUSE field
      + 
  
+ Recombination time:
  + Dense gas:
    + n_e = 100 pcc
    + \alpha \approx 2e-13
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1600 years
  + He II gas
    + n_e = 11 pcc
    + \alpha = 1.5e-12
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1920 years
  + So almost the same!  The lower density is compensated by a higher recombination rate
  + So recomb timescale of a few thousand years is small compared with stellar evolution timescale, even for WR stars

***** Conversion of spectral type to ionizing luminosity

:END:
+ Galactic case is done by Martins:2005a
  + Application to Carina in Smith:2006a
  + But what about the SMC abundances?
****** Spectral type to effective temperature
+ Massey:2005z show the S. Type - T_eff relations for MW vs SMC
  file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210527-134032.png
  + They find that SMC stars a bit hotter (green line) for both supergiants and dwarfs
  + I have inserted these temperatures as a column in the above table
+ [ ] But what about bespoke stellar parameter determinations?
  + Massey:2000l have
    + Q = (U - B) - 0.72 (B - V)
    + This is supposedly a reddening-free index
    + Then 
      - For Q < -0.6 and either (B - V)_0 < 0.0 or (U - B)_0 < -0.6,
      - log Teff = 4.2622 + 0.64525 Q + 1.09174 Q^2, (V)
      - log Teff = 5.2618 + 3.42004 Q + 2.93489 Q^2, (III)
      - log Teff = -0.9894 - 22.767380 Q -  33.09637 Q^2 16.19307 Q^3 (I)
  + However, I can't be bothered to look up all the UBV photometry necessary to do this
****** Luminosities, radii
+ We need the gravity to get the q_1 ionizing flux from the stellar atmosphere
  + function of T_eff, g, Z
+ But then we need the R to convert to luminosity Q_1
+ But we also have L_bol = 4 \pi R^2 T_eff^4
  + And we can find L_bol from M_V and bolometric correction
  + BC is known as a function of T_eff
    + E.g., BC = -6.90 log Teff + 27.99
    + Massey:2005z, equation (2)
    + From this, we can calculate the radii from M_V
      + If we know A_V
+ This is done in the table
****** Masses, gravity
+ [ ] The gravity should have a calibration with luminosity class
****** Ionizing fluxes
+ If the fluxes q_0 are not a strong function of g, then we don't need to find the gravity
+ We can use the same q_0 as in Martins:2005a, but using our T_eff, rather than their Galactic calibration
+ Apparently, the direct effect of metallicity on q_0 is small, but q_1 should be higher at lower metallicities
  + Quote regarding this from Martins:2005a section 6:
    : From the modelling side, Kudritzki (2002) and Mokiem et al. (2004)
    : have investigated the effect of a change of the metal content on the
    : spectral energy distribution of O dwarfs using CMFGEN models. They
    : found that H ionising fluxes are essentially unchanged when Z is
    : varied between twice and one tenth the solar content. They argue that
    : the redistribution of the flux blocked by metals at short wavelengths
    : takes place within the Lyman continuum, which explains the observed
    : behaviour. However, they show that the SEDs are strongly modified
    : below ~450 \AA, spectra being softer at higher metallicity (see also
    : Sect. 5.3.1). Morisset et al. (2004) have computed various WM-BASIC
    : models at different metallicities and showed how Z affected the
    : strength of mid-IR nebular lines emitted in compact H I regions. The
    : softening of the SEDs when metallicity increases is crucial to
    : understand the behaviour of observed excitation sequences.
***** Helium-plus ionizing luminosities 
+ This is important for the bow shock ionization
+ We are also interested in the ionization of Ar III -> Ar IV
  + This requires 40.735 eV, compared with 35.121 eV for O III and 54.418 eV for He II
  + Ar IV can persist in the He II zone since Ar IV -> V requires 59.58 eV

+ Based on the notebook [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.md]]
+ There I find that Q_2 = 2.8e45 /s
  + Old value of Q_2 = 4.7e45 /s was not using the right temperature
+ And I also found that n_e = 9.5 +/- 0.5 /cm^3
  + But that has to be multiplied by sqrt((1.0824 + 0.0824 x) / 1.1648 x)
  + Where x is the He++ fraction
  + And where we can simplify to 1 / sqrt(x) to +/- 10%
  + So another way of putting this is that x = (10/n_e)^2
+ The distance of the inner edge from the star is 4 arcsec = 4 9.23e+17 cm = 1.2 pc
+ So the ionizing flux is F_2 = Q_2 / 4 \pi R^2 = 1.625e+07 phot/s/cm^2
+ This should be equal to n_e n_i \alpha_B h = y_He x n_e^2 \alpha_B h / (1 + 2 y_He)
  + Assuming y_He = 0.082 and \alpha_B = 1.2e-12 cm^3/s
  + h = 1.165 F / y_He x n_e^2 \alpha_B = 1.165 1.625e+07 / 0.082 10**2 1.2e-12 = 1.9e18 cm = 0.61 pc
    + 1 arcsec = 0.3 pc
    + So this is 2 arcsec - just right!
+ *Return to this* [2021-07-23 Fri]
  + We now have Q_2 = (2.8 +/- 0.1)e45
  + Found the mistake! I missed a factor of 4 in the distance
  + I am going to now edit the values above
  + Now it all works out fine.
****** Estimating He++ ionization fraction
+ Now that we have the F_2 flux determined we can estimate the He++ x from local ionization balance:
  + (1 - x) y n \sigma F_2 = x y n^2 (1 + 2 y)  \alpha
  + x / (1 - x) = \sigma F_2 / \alpha n
  + We have all these ingredients except for \sigma, which we can easily find since it is hydrogenic
  + Turns out to be about 1.6e-18 cm^2 at threshold
  + Therefore, we can find
    + \sigma F_2 / \alpha n = 1.6e-18 1.625e+07 / 1.2e-12 (10 / sqrt(x)) = 2.17 sqrt(x)
    + x^{1/2} / (1 - x) = 2.17 => x = 0.63
  + So n = 13 pcc
  + Is this consistent with the Cloudy models?
    + Yes, more or less - but it requires the density to fall with radius

      + clumping increases gradually from sonic point to 10 R_*
    + all models assume D = 10
  + Models are with log Q = -13.0, -12.0, -14.0 for SMC-OB-I, II, III, respectively
    + Although in some places it says -13.5, -12.5, -14.5
    + But that is using a different definition of Q that does not include the sqrt(D) factor 
  + Work through for SMC-OB-II 50-42
    + R_STAR = 10.137 R_SUN
    + V = 3020 km/s
    + log M_dot = -5.771
    + D = 10
    + => log Q = log10(sqrt(10) 10**-5.771 (10.137 3020)**(-3/2)) = -12.0
  + Therefore, we should have Mdot scaling as Q R^{3/2} or Q L^{3/4}
    + This is now implemented in the final column of the above table
***** Correction for wind velocity 
+ From the previous section, we also have Mdot scaling as Q Vinf^{3/2}
+ We have a measured Vinf for W 3: 2800 km/s
+ So we should do an additional rescaling of Mdot by (2800 / Vinf)^{3/2}, where Vinf is the value from the POWR model
+ This is now also implemented in the final column


***** TODO What is this "excitation parameter" that the early papers mention?
+ It has units of pc cm^-2, which is length

****** Conclusions for Walborn 3
- log L = 6.12
- T = 51.7 kK
- Mdot = -6.65, so 2.239e-07 Msun/yr, which is very low for a supergiant
- This is more consistent with the hotter solution, whereas I was using the cooler one
*** What to call the stars?
+ My current plan is just to use the Sabbi ID numbers, which are in order of V brightness
  + SIMBAD says:
    : dic: Table 2: <Cl* NGC 346 SSN NNNNNN> N=79960 among (Nos 1-132733). Table 3: <[SSN2007] Sc NN> (Nos 1-16).
  + So I can just abbreviate it as SSN 152, SSN 168, etc
+ Alternative lists:
  + MPG gets used a lot

*** Different components of mYSO C
+ There are two continuum sources, presumably stars
  + Separated by about 0.3 arcsec
  + Sabbi ID 152 and 168
    + MPG 454 corresponds to both of them
  + The NE source 
    + Sabbi ID 152
+ Other correspondences
  + SSTS3MC 14.7725-72.1766 from Simon:2007r
    + They estimate 3.4e4 Lsun and 15 Msun
    + Their source includes both stars
  + Contursi:2000f give spectrum (their Peak C in Fig 6)
    + They estimate G_0 = 8.7e5
    + [ ] *We can use this to get a distance from the star maybe*
  + Whelan:2013d source PS 9
    + Spectrum is different from other sources
    + Prominent Silicate emission
    + Strangely low PAH 7.7/11.3 ratio although normal 6.2/11.3 ratio
  + Sewio:2013f
    + Source Y535
  + Rubio:2018f have the most comprehensive study
    + They have near-IR imaging and spectra
    + And they compare with the literature measurements 
*** SED modelling of the YSOs
+ Robitaille:2006f is what everyone uses
+ Although Zhang:2018k claim their models are more physically consistent
*** Massive YSOs in other regions

+ van-Gelder:2020z do X-shooter spectroscopy of sources in the LMC
  + Their Fig 13 shows Br\gamma luminosity vs K-band magnitude for a whole bunch of sources from MW, SMC, and LMC: 
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210524-110837.png]]
  + The ones that are way above the trend line might be good candidates for looking for Raman scattering
  + The SMC sources are in this category: relatively bright in Br\gamma
    + For Source C, observed K_S = 12.05, meaning M_K = 12.05 - 18.95 = -6.9
    + This means it must be the rightmost orange square, so L(Br\gamma) = 30 L_\odot, which corresponds to Q(H) = 8.554e+48 /s (see conversion factor from below)
    + So that would be like an O7V star if 100% covering factor
    + [0/2] But some questions remain?
      + [ ] How is Br\gamma flux apportioned between different components (two compact sources plus surrounding globule)?
        + This could be addressed by using the H\alpha fluxes from HST and/or MUSE
      + [ ] How feasible is external, rather than internal illumination?
        + For the globule it must be external because of the ionization gradient (seen in [O III] compared with H\alpha for instance)
  + Conversion of Br\gamma to other measures:
    + Br\gamma is 7 \to 4 transition
    + Equivalent H\beta
      + Table 4.2 of Osterbrock book has j(Br\gamma) / j(H\beta) = 0.0281
        + For T = 1e4 K in low-density limit
      + So 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma means 35.6 L_\odot of H\beta
    + Equivalent H\alpha
      + j(H\alpha) / j(H\beta) = 2.87
      + => 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma = 102.1 L_\odot of H\alpha
      + That is worth remembering: *H\alpha / Br\gamma = 100* more or less
    + Equivalent Q(H)
      + L(H\beta) = e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) VEM
      + Q(H) = \alpha_B VEM
      + => Q(H) = [\alpha_B / e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta)] L(H\beta)
      + \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
      + e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) = 1.24e-25 erg cm^3/s
        + (This is 4\pi j(H\beta) / n_e n_p in the Osterbrock table)
      + => Q(H) = (2.6e-13 / 1.24e-25) 35.6 3.82e33 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + => Q(H) = 2.85e+47 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + Remember, this is assuming 100% area covering fraction of ionization-bounded matter (no escape) and no EUV absorbed by dust.
        + So it is a lower limit on Q(H)
    + So th1C would be way above the line, at M_K, L(Br\gamma) = -3.6, 30
      + *but* that is assuming all ionizing photons trapped nearby
      + In reality, Orion S has much lower flux than this would imply
      + [ ] /need to calculate H\alpha flux from Orion S/

** Analysis of Raman wings of SMC N66 mYSO C
+ Optically thick out past 100 \AA
  + Must have column of > 1e22 H^0 / cm^2
  + Suggests low dust cross section
*** What we need for a paper
+ Spectrum of Raman wings
  + Obviously Ha
  + But also look at Hb too
+ Deal with the sky problems
  + Nebular over-subtraction
    + Puts the emission lines in absorption in the faint regions
  + Telluric over-division
    + Puts telluric absorption bands in emission in spectra of bright stars
+ Spatial profiles in wings, continuum, Ha, [S II], [O III]
  + When is it spatially resolved and when not?
+ Look at more lines
  + [S III] and [Ar III] to see if they look more like Ha (central peak) or like [O III] (hole in middle)
  + Extinction from Ha/Hb - does the core of the line have nebular extinction (very small) or stellar extinction (A_V = 2.5)?
+ Density/temperature diagnostics
  + We have an [S II] density, but in the presence of gradients/inhomogeneities that will be biased towards low densities
  + Can we get any [Fe III] densities?
    + Mabel used 4986 / 4658
+ Kinematics
  + Local maximum in sigma(Ha) - but is that the line core, or the effect of the Raman wings?
+ Analysis
  + Optical depth of Raman scattering
    + Does it require dust destruction?
  + General thoughts on the young cluster
    + many of the stars seem to be aligned in chains
    + there is a 3-pronged "bird foot" pattern coming out of the brightest compact sub-cluster
    + the chains are approximately aligned with the filaments seen in the gas

**** He II 4686
+ Another great line - it shows a beautiful emission arc just inside the [Ar IV] emission
+ We can calculate the flux and then convert to a > 4 Ryd luminosity and see if this is consistent with expected stellar EUV
+ The arc shows no extinction by the globule filaments, and so must be foreground to them
