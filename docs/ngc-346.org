** Details of Raman profiles

:ID:       BA4EBC34-BC84-46ED-90D9-4C4C44EDAC98
:END:
- Most of this is in the globule around mYSO-C
  - All the other emission (for example, from the filaments) is very weak
- [2022-10-26 Wed] I have done new continuum subtractions with a broader window, which work better for the Ha wings
- See also [[id:F52B6E46-AC8D-40EB-9548-7441D7C6DA29][Analysis of Raman wings of SMC N66 mYSO C]]
*** Extent of flat top to profile
- This should tell us the wavelength where the profile becomes optically thin
*** Absorption lines

**** The O I lines
- These are seen only in the globule spectrum with any certainty
  - Note that the csub-101 spectrum loses the Raman wings, since they are more than 100 pixels wide
- In other regions, they are too easily confused with the two Deep Neutral UILs on either side of them
**** The Si II line
- This is at 6480.811 \AA rest STP
- Which is 6484.48 with systemic redshift
- We do see absorption at that wavelength in the YSO spectrum
  - Although it is less deep than the O I lines
**** The He II lines
- In the Ha profile, we see absorption at 6545, which may well be the Raman scattered counterpart of He II 1025.272, which is just to the blue of H I 1025.722
  - 6547.4 observed wavelength in YSO means 6543.6 rest optical
    - Difference in wave numbers from Ha is 45.2 /cm
    - Which gives UV wavelength of 1 / (97492.283 + 45.2) = 1025.25, which is close enough
- This line is seen in emission in the PNe NGC 6888 and NGC 6881
  - Choi:2020c
**** The new broad absorptions [2022-10-24 Mon]
- There are many more features in the near Raman wings, which can be seen most clearly around the GLOB-E region, but generally in the neutral gas
- These are the approximate observed wavelengths (rest wavelengths)
  - Red wing 6600 (6596)
    - This is the strongest, with a parabolic shape in the near red wing
    - In the csub-101 cube, the trough has negative values
    - The spatial distribution /seems/ to track the Raman wings
    - But it might just be tracking the shadow of the Ha core emission (the depression halo around the strong line due to subtracting the median-filtered continuum)
    - We should try a 1001 pixel median filter to see if it works better
    - Note that there is maybe even a hint that we are seeing a very shallow version of this in Orion
  - Red wing 6612 (6608)
    - Just a bit further out in the red wing, and might be a bit broader
    - The gap between this one and the last one is classified as a candidate emission line #1603 in the spreadsheet, but if I am right about the two absorption lines, then it is not really an emission line but will just be showing a little bit of the Raman wing.
  - Blue wing XXX
    - There are some genuine emission lines, probably Deep Neutral, which complicate things on this side: #1524 (6505 observed) and #1547 (6534 observed)
    - There may be some absorption here, but it is hard to tell

** General points about the globules and filaments
- The background globules show bright heads and less bright flanks
  - This is evidence for the local anisotropy of the radiation field
  - And that the tail axis is aligned with the radiation
  - Suggesting that the globules have been sculpted to some extent (unless it is simply chance)
- The foreground ridge, on the other hand, does not look like this
  - It seems more to be illuminated from the side
** Lines of interest
+ Still to do:
  + [O I] 6300, 6363
  + [S III] 6312, 9069
  + O I 8446
  + [Cl IV] 8045
  + [C I] 8727
  + [Fe III]
** General thoughts
+ Properties of N66 from Lopez:2014a
  + Q(H) = 4e50 /s = 40 x Orion
  + n = 100 pcc = 0.03 x Orion
    + In both cases there are large variations, however
  + R = 64 pc = 30 x Orion
  + *therefore* (n R) and (Q n) are both similar to Orion, so ionization parameter is similar too
*** Comparison of size scales and luminosities between Orion and SMC
+ SMC distance: 61.7 kpc
  + Distance modulus: 5 log10(D/10 pc) = 18.95
  + The brightest star in the vicinity of source C is V = 15
    + => M_V = 15 - 18.95 = -3.95
    + This is only 0.5 mag brighter than th1C, so probably O6V
  + Sun has M_V = +4.81 => V = 23.76
  + 10 pc = 33.43 arcsec, 50 pc = 167.2 arcsec    
+ Orion
  + Distance: 410 pc => 150 times closer
    + Distance modulus: 5 log10(D/10 pc) = 8.06
  + Size of Orion S region: R = 30 arcsec = 0.06 pc
    + 0.2 arcsec @ SMC = *1 MUSE pixel !!!*
  + Separation between Trapezium stars: about 5 arcsec = 0.01 pc
    + 0.03 arcsec @ SMC
  + Separation of Orion S from theta 1 C: R = 55 arcsec = 0.1 pc
    + 0.4 arcsec @ SMC = 2 pixels
  + Separation of Orion-BNKL from theta 1 C = 75 arcsec = 0.15 pc
    + 0.5 arcsec @ SMS = 2.5 pixels
    + BN and Src I are high-mass protostars in the BNKL region
  + Separation of th2A from th1C: R = 140 arcsec = 0.28 pc
    + 0.93 arcsec @ SMC = 5 pixels
  + Entire region studied in Orion paper: 360 x 270 arcsec

*** The photospheric profiles around Ly\beta

*** Ionizing stars in N66

**** Contribution of the WR+WR binary HD 5980
+ Considerable variation over last 20 years
+ *Conclusions*
  + For the low state, we have Q_0 = 1e50 approx
  + And a very low Q_2 (so no ionizing to He II)
+ High state (1994):
  + log L = 6.6
  + T_* = 47 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 111e-5
  + Vinf = 750 km/s
  + R_10 = 28 Rsun
+ Low state (2014):
  + log L = 6.23
  + T_* = 48 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 14e-5
  + Vinf = 2100 km/s
  + R_10 = 19 Rsun
+ Transformation for POWR models
  - All their models are for nominal log L = 5.3
  - They use a transformed radius: R_t = R_* (V_inf / 2500 km/s)^{2/3} (Mdot sqrt(D) / 1e-4)^{-2/3}
    - where D = 1/f is clumping factor
  - For a different luminosity, we must rescale R_* as L^{1/2}
  - And Mdot scales as L^{3/4}
  - So we have:
    - High state:
      - R_* = 28 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.6)) = 6.268 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((750/2500)/ (11.1))**(2/3) = 0.09 6.268 = 0.56412 Rsun => -0.248 on log10 scale
        - Unfortunately, that is off the bottom of the grid!
    - Low state:
      - Luminosity is 10**(6.23 - 5.3) = 8.5 times higher than fiducial
      - R_* = 19 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.23)) = 6.513 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((2100/2500)/ (1.4))**(2/3) = 0.7114 6.513 = 4.633 Rsun => 0.6659 on log 10 scale
+ So for the low state, the closest model is 06-14: T = 44.7 kK, log Rt = 0.7
  + This comes with R_* = 7.5 => rescaled: 7.5 sqrt(8.5) = 21.9 Rsun
    + (close enough to 19)
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.01, 47.69, 0.00, 45.77 - so very soft
    + Rescaled back to real luminosity: Q_0 = 49.01 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 49.94
  + Mdot = -4.23 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.23) = 2.93e-4
    + this is not entirely consistent with the original 1.4e-4
  + V = 1600 km/s
+ We should also look at the closest hotter model 07-13: T = 50000 K, log Rt = 0.8
  + R_* = 5.9 => rescaled: 5.9 sqrt(8.5) = 17 Rsun
    + So this model and the previous one nicely bracket 19 Rsun
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.09, 48.47, 36.46, 47.42 - so not so soft, but still almost no He+ ionizing radiation
    + Rescaled ionizing luminosity: 49.09 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 50.02
  + Mdot = -4.53 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.53) = 1.47e-4
    + Very close to original

+ M_bol = V + BC - AV - DM
  + DM = 18.95
  + AV = 0.3 approx (assuming E(B-V) = 0.1)
  + I have added an extra 1 mag extinction by hand to SSN 168
+ L/Lsun = 10**(0.4 (M_sun - M_bol))
  + M_sun = 4.73
+ R = sqrt(L / 4 \pi \sigma T^4)
+ So in terms of bolometric flux, the nearby B star totally dominates
+ But we should work out the external luminosity incident on the globule
  + And not include SSN 168 since that is on the inside
  + Sum over stars of luminosity x area covering fraction: \sum_i L_i \Omega_i / 4\pi
  + \Omega_i / 4\pi = A_glob / 4\pi d^2 = \pi r_glob^2 / 4\pi d^2 = r_glob^2 / 4 d^2
  + Take r_glob = 1 arcsec
+ The result is a total of 1.3e4 Lsun, of which half comes from W 2
+ So this is less than the inner luminosity from SSN 168 (3e4), if that was all trapped
  + Also, the external luminosities are upper limits, assuming that everything is in the plane of the sky
+ I have done the same for the ionizing luminosity
  + I get a total external incident luminosity of Q_ext = 6.3e47 s^-1
  + As opposed to an internal luminosity from the B0V star of 4e47 s^-1
  + The external incident luminosity is split up as follows
    + 40% from W 2
    + 24% from W 1
    + 17% from SSN 22
    + 6% from W 3
    + 13% from the rest (each 3% or less)
+ [ ] Now, we need to compare this with the Ha luminosity of the globule and of the inner sources
***** Relative contributions to the global ionization balance
+ The list above has all the stars with Q_0 > 5e48 I think
  + Except for some more that a long way to S or N
+ Total luminosity is 4.3e50
  + Could be 5.3e50 if we add in both WR stars as equals
  + Lopez:2014a give 50.6 -> 4e50
    + This is based on a simple conversion of the H\alpha luminosity of log L(Ha) = 38.6
    + [ ] We should compare that with the flux measured in our MUSE field
      + 
  
+ Recombination time:
  + Dense gas:
    + n_e = 100 pcc
    + \alpha \approx 2e-13
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1600 years
  + He II gas
    + n_e = 11 pcc
    + \alpha = 1.5e-12
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1920 years
  + So almost the same!  The lower density is compensated by a higher recombination rate
  + So recomb timescale of a few thousand years is small compared with stellar evolution timescale, even for WR stars
+

+ Galactic case is done by Martins:2005a
  + Application to Carina in Smith:2006a
  + But what about the SMC abundances?
****** Spectral type to effective temperature
+ Massey:2005z show the S. Type - T_eff relations for MW vs SMC
  file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210527-134032.png
  + They find that SMC stars a bit hotter (green line) for both supergiants and dwarfs
  + I have inserted these temperatures as a column in the above table
+ [ ] But what about bespoke stellar parameter determinations?
  + Massey:2000l have
    + Q = (U - B) - 0.72 (B - V)
    + This is supposedly a reddening-free index
    + Then 
      - For Q < -0.6 and either (B - V)_0 < 0.0 or (U - B)_0 < -0.6,
      - log Teff = 4.2622 + 0.64525 Q + 1.09174 Q^2, (V)
      - log Teff = 5.2618 + 3.42004 Q + 2.93489 Q^2, (III)
      - log Teff = -0.9894 - 22.767380 Q -  33.09637 Q^2 16.19307 Q^3 (I)
  + However, I can't be bothered to look up all the UBV photometry necessary to do this
****** Luminosities, radii
+ We need the gravity to get the q_1 ionizing flux from the stellar atmosphere
  + function of T_eff, g, Z
+ But then we need the R to convert to luminosity Q_1
+ But we also have L_bol = 4 \pi R^2 T_eff^4
  + And we can find L_bol from M_V and bolometric correction
  + BC is known as a function of T_eff
    + E.g., BC = -6.90 log Teff + 27.99
    + Massey:2005z, equation (2)
    + From this, we can calculate the radii from M_V
      + If we know A_V
+ This is done in the table
****** Masses, gravity
+ [ ] The gravity should have a calibration with luminosity class
****** Ionizing fluxes
+ If the fluxes q_0 are not a strong function of g, then we don't need to find the gravity
+ We can use the same q_0 as in Martins:2005a, but using our T_eff, rather than their Galactic calibration
+ Apparently, the direct effect of metallicity on q_0 is small, but q_1 should be higher at lower metallicities
  + Quote regarding this from Martins:2005a section 6:
    : From the modelling side, Kudritzki (2002) and Mokiem et al. (2004)
    : have investigated the effect of a change of the metal content on the
    : spectral energy distribution of O dwarfs using CMFGEN models. They
    : found that H ionising fluxes are essentially unchanged when Z is
    : varied between twice and one tenth the solar content. They argue that
    : the redistribution of the flux blocked by metals at short wavelengths
    : takes place within the Lyman continuum, which explains the observed
    : behaviour. However, they show that the SEDs are strongly modified
    : below ~450 \AA, spectra being softer at higher metallicity (see also
    : Sect. 5.3.1). Morisset et al. (2004) have computed various WM-BASIC
    : models at different metallicities and showed how Z affected the
    : strength of mid-IR nebular lines emitted in compact H I regions. The
    : softening of the SEDs when metallicity increases is crucial to
    : understand the behaviour of observed excitation sequences.

+ *Updated [2024-04-14 Sun] with new concordance solutions for He++ ionization*
+ There I find that Q_2 = (6.8 +/- 3.4)e45 /s 
  + Previous value of 2.8e45 /s was not taking into account extinction and assuming a larger covering fraction
  + Even more previous value of Q_2 = 4.7e45 /s was not using the right temperature
+ And I also found that n_H = (35 +/- 10) cm^-3 is the hydrogen nucleon density
  + The He++ fraction is measured to be x_{He++} = 0.1
    + This comes from the value of about \langle x_{He++} \rang = 0.016 for the entire line of sight, but then taking into account the He++ shell being half of the H+ shell, which is in turn 30% of the total emission measure
  + The electron density is n_e = x_e n_H where x_e = 1 + y (1 + x_{He++}) assuming no neutral helium
    + so n_e = 1.09 n_H
+ The distance of the inner edge from the star is 4 arcsec = 4 9.23e+17 cm = 1.2 pc
+ So the ionizing flux is F_2 = Q_2 / 4 \pi R^2 = 3.95e07 phot/s/cm^2
+ This should be equal to n_e n_i \alpha_B h = y_He x_e x_{He++} n^2 \alpha_B h 
  + Assuming y_He = 0.082 and \alpha_B = 1.2e-12 cm^3/s
  + y_He x_e x_{He++} = 0.082 1.09 0.1 = 0.009
  + h = F / y_He x_e x_{He++} n^2 \alpha_B =  3.95e07 / 0.009 35**2 1.2e-12 = 3.0e18 cm = 0.97 pc
    + 1 arcsec = 0.3 pc
    + So this is 3 arcsec - marginally OK

  + x / (1 - x) = \sigma F_2 / 1.09 \alpha n
  + We have all these ingredients except for \sigma, which we can easily find since it is hydrogenic
  + Turns out to be about 1.6e-18 cm^2 at threshold
  + Therefore, we can find
    + \sigma F_2 / \alpha n = 1.6e-18 3.95e+07 / 1.2e-12 35 = 1.5
    + x / (1 - x) = 1.5 => x = 0.63

+ The Q0' (H0) and Q2' (He+) columns are ionizing luminosities rescaled so that the model has a bolometric luminosity of log L = 5.98, as implied by the cooler Rivero-Gonzalez solution

  + For T = 50,000 K only the strong wind model SMC-OB-II (strong wind) 50-42 model is consistent with the observed Q2 value
    + log Mdot = -5.66=> Mdot = 2e-6
    + The weak wind model has 10x too small a value of Q2, and intermediate wind model has 2.5x too small a value
  + The higher gravity model (50-44) is similiar in that only the stronger wind model works
    + log Mdot = -5.66 => Mdot = 2e-6
  + The lower temperature model (49-42) only marginally consistent with observed Q2 for the strongest wind (SMC-OB-II: Q2 = 45.60), which implies Mdot = 2.34e-6
+ In summary, the He++ ionizing luminosity is a strong function of Teff and Mdot, but very weak gravity dependence

***** Correction for radius
+ The POWR models are a bit sub-luminous compared with W3
  + SMC-OB-I 50-42 has log L = 5.76
  + W3 has log L = 5.98 (cooler) to 6.08 (hotter)
  + Take the cooler one to start with, for consistency with the POWR Teff
  + So to rescale all the luminosities, we would add 0.22 in log space
  + Each model has a different nominal luminosity, so I am going to have to add in
+ Scaling of Mdot when luminosity is adjusted
  + Q = Mdot D^{1/2} (Rstar Vinf)^{-3/2}
    + where D is the clumping factor (D = 1/f) at 10 R_*
      + clumping increases gradually from sonic point to 10 R_*
    + all models assume D = 10
  + Models are with log Q = -13.0, -12.0, -14.0 for SMC-OB-I, II, III, respectively
    + Although in some places it says -13.5, -12.5, -14.5
    + But that is using a different definition of Q that does not include the sqrt(D) factor 
  + Work through for SMC-OB-II 50-42
    + R_STAR = 10.137 R_SUN
    + V = 3020 km/s
    + log M_dot = -5.771
    + D = 10
    + => log Q = log10(sqrt(10) 10**-5.771 (10.137 3020)**(-3/2)) = -12.0
  + Therefore, we should have Mdot scaling as Q R^{3/2} or Q L^{3/4}
    + This is now implemented in the final column of the above table
***** Correction for wind velocity 
+ From the previous section, we also have Mdot scaling as Q Vinf^{3/2}
+ We have a measured Vinf for W 3: 2800 km/s
+ So we should do an additional rescaling of Mdot by (2800 / Vinf)^{3/2}, where Vinf is the value from the POWR model
+ This is now also implemented in the final column


***** TODO What is this "excitation parameter" that the early papers mention?
+ It has units of pc cm^-2, which is length

****** Conclusions for Walborn 3
- log L = 6.12
- T = 51.7 kK
- Mdot = -6.65, so 2.239e-07 Msun/yr, which is very low for a supergiant
- This is more consistent with the hotter solution, whereas I was using the cooler one
*** More new papers on the stars
**** Hawcroft:2024a
- Analysis of wind parameters in LMC and SMC
- Finds very tight correlation of V_\infty with effective temperature
- And slight variation with metallicity
- W 3 (SSN 9, MPG 355) is not included in their high-quality sample
  : The temperature coverage in the SMC can be extended by adding equally
  : high-quality measurements from literature sam- ples compiled in Garcia
  : et al. (2014), and additional measure- ments from Bouret et al.
  : (2021). The high temperature coverage is provided by essentially one
  : star (NGC346 MPG 355) that is included in the ULLYSES sample, but does
  : not show satu- ration in the C IV λλ1548–1551 and so is not included
  : in our highest-quality rank sub-sample. However, this star does show
  : saturation in the N V λλ1239–1243 profile, which is fitted in Bouret
  : et al. (2021), therefore we chose to include this literature
  : measurement. Furthermore, the measured terminal wind speeds for this
  : star in this work and Bouret et al. (2021) agree to within 150 km s−1.
- So they defer to Bouret:2021h, but I think they must mean Bouret:2013m who measured V_\infty = 2800 km/s
**** Mang-Roman:2025a
- Br gamma lines from O stars from JWST NIRSPEC
  - This should give a sensitive measure of the mass-loss rate
  - Lower Mdot gives stronger line
- Very light on analysis and says that all results are tentative
  - Does not actually determine an Mdot fpr W 3
- Finds that stellar luminosities from infrared are lower than UV-derived ones
  - Obtains log L = 5.91 ± 0.05 for W 3, as opposed to 6.12 from Rickard
**** Marcolino:2022a
- use CMFGEN to analyze lots of stars and their winds across MW and SMC
- For W 3 they get
  - log L = 6.04 +/- 0.10
  - T_eff = 51.7 kK
  - R = 13.17 Rsun
  - log Mdot = -5.89
  - V_\infty = 2800 km/s
  - log D = 28.92 +/- 0.05
- Note that the Mdot is for no clumping, f = 1, otherwise it is rescaled by sqrt(f)
- They also talk about the bow shock mass-loss rates
  - But they only use Kobulnicky, not our recalculation
  - We could probably do a much better job of this by using a sample of H II regions with bow shocks that are visible in gas emission
*** What to call the stars?
+ My current plan is just to use the Sabbi ID numbers, which are in order of V brightness
  + SIMBAD says:
    : dic: Table 2: <Cl* NGC 346 SSN NNNNNN> N=79960 among (Nos 1-132733). Table 3: <[SSN2007] Sc NN> (Nos 1-16).
  + So I can just abbreviate it as SSN 152, SSN 168, etc
+ Alternative lists:
  + MPG gets used a lot

*** Different components of mYSO C
+ There are two continuum sources, presumably stars
  + Separated by about 0.3 arcsec
  + Sabbi ID 152 and 168
    + MPG 454 corresponds to both of them
  + The NE source 
    + Sabbi ID 152
+ Other correspondences
  + SSTS3MC 14.7725-72.1766 from Simon:2007r
    + They estimate 3.4e4 Lsun and 15 Msun
    + Their source includes both stars
  + Contursi:2000f give spectrum (their Peak C in Fig 6)
    + They estimate G_0 = 8.7e5
    + [ ] *We can use this to get a distance from the star maybe*
  + Whelan:2013d source PS 9
    + Spectrum is different from other sources
    + Prominent Silicate emission
    + Strangely low PAH 7.7/11.3 ratio although normal 6.2/11.3 ratio
  + Sewio:2013f
    + Source Y535
  + Rubio:2018f have the most comprehensive study
    + They have near-IR imaging and spectra
    + And they compare with the literature measurements 
*** SED modelling of the YSOs

+ van-Gelder:2020z do X-shooter spectroscopy of sources in the LMC
  + Their Fig 13 shows Br\gamma luminosity vs K-band magnitude for a whole bunch of sources from MW, SMC, and LMC: 
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210524-110837.png]]
  + The ones that are way above the trend line might be good candidates for looking for Raman scattering
  + The SMC sources are in this category: relatively bright in Br\gamma
    + For Source C, observed K_S = 12.05, meaning M_K = 12.05 - 18.95 = -6.9
    + This means it must be the rightmost orange square, so L(Br\gamma) = 30 L_\odot, which corresponds to Q(H) = 8.554e+48 /s (see conversion factor from below)
    + So that would be like an O7V star if 100% covering factor
    + [0/2] But some questions remain?
      + [ ] How is Br\gamma flux apportioned between different components (two compact sources plus surrounding globule)?
        + This could be addressed by using the H\alpha fluxes from HST and/or MUSE
      + [ ] How feasible is external, rather than internal illumination?
        + For the globule it must be external because of the ionization gradient (seen in [O III] compared with H\alpha for instance)
  + Conversion of Br\gamma to other measures:
    + Br\gamma is 7 \to 4 transition
    + Equivalent H\beta
      + Table 4.2 of Osterbrock book has j(Br\gamma) / j(H\beta) = 0.0281
        + For T = 1e4 K in low-density limit
      + So 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma means 35.6 L_\odot of H\beta
    + Equivalent H\alpha
      + j(H\alpha) / j(H\beta) = 2.87
      + => 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma = 102.1 L_\odot of H\alpha
      + That is worth remembering: *H\alpha / Br\gamma = 100* more or less
    + Equivalent Q(H)
      + L(H\beta) = e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) VEM
      + Q(H) = \alpha_B VEM
      + => Q(H) = [\alpha_B / e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta)] L(H\beta)
      + \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
      + e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) = 1.24e-25 erg cm^3/s
        + (This is 4\pi j(H\beta) / n_e n_p in the Osterbrock table)
      + => Q(H) = (2.6e-13 / 1.24e-25) 35.6 3.82e33 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + => Q(H) = 2.85e+47 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + Remember, this is assuming 100% area covering fraction of ionization-bounded matter (no escape) and no EUV absorbed by dust.
        + So it is a lower limit on Q(H)
    + So th1C would be way above the line, at M_K, L(Br\gamma) = -3.6, 30
      + *but* that is assuming all ionizing photons trapped nearby
      + In reality, Orion S has much lower flux than this would imply
      + [ ] /need to calculate H\alpha flux from Orion S/

    + Small one around source C
      + R \approx 0.3 pc
    + Larger ones have R up to about 0.5 pc, but there are many smaller ones too
    + How close are they to the core of the cluster?
      + MUSE field has a radius of about 15 pc
      + Closest "normal" globules to cluster center have a projected distance of about 1 pc from center of cluster, which has W 2 (O 8.5)
      + Globule surrounding Source C has separation of about 0.5 pc
      + W 1 (O4) is projected right on top of the upper filament, but it must be a way in the foreground since the globules do not point towards it
      + Brightest rims are seen in ones off to E (in Sc 2) with a separation of about 3 pc,
        so those are probably the physically closest (apart from MYSO C globule)
      + *Conclusion* is distance of 3 to 15 pc for most, but 0.5 pc for the one around C

  + When is it spatially resolved and when not?
+ Look at more lines
  + [S III] and [Ar III] to see if they look more like Ha (central peak) or like [O III] (hole in middle)
  + Extinction from Ha/Hb - does the core of the line have nebular extinction (very small) or stellar extinction (A_V = 2.5)?
+ Density/temperature diagnostics
  + We have an [S II] density, but in the presence of gradients/inhomogeneities that will be biased towards low densities
  + Can we get any [Fe III] densities?
    + Mabel used 4986 / 4658
+ Kinematics
  + Local maximum in sigma(Ha) - but is that the line core, or the effect of the Raman wings?
+ Analysis
  + Optical depth of Raman scattering
    + Does it require dust destruction?
  + General thoughts on the young cluster
    + many of the stars seem to be aligned in chains
    + there is a 3-pronged "bird foot" pattern coming out of the brightest compact sub-cluster
    + the chains are approximately aligned with the filaments seen in the gas
*** Going through the lines we need
+ I am currently doing these for the sharper cube

**** Stars of moderate interest
This is a list of moderately interesting stars that are showing up in my line analysis
***** SSN 258
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ This is the slightly fainter star below SSN 62 in the globule just N of our main source
+ It is not in SIMBAD but has V = 17.26 (M_V = -1.69) and V-I = 0.167
  + That puts it around B4 spectral type according to Fig 5 of Martayan:2010j
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-121509.png]]
+ It has strong [N I] 5200 line emission
  + Possible spatially extended, but not much
+ Also shows Si II 5056
***** SSN 552
+ This one is just outside the cluster box in the star figures
+ In a globule
+ It is quite faint and red
  + V = 18.217, V-I = 0.616
+ Shows the Si II 5056, 5041 line but not much else
***** SSN 73

+ [[http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-coo?Coord=0%3A59%3A01.8832+-72%3A11%3A02.100&CooFrame=FK5&CooEpoch=2000&CooEqui=2000&CooDefinedFrames=none&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcsec&submit=submit+query][Simbad link]] shows it as "emission line star", B1
  + Probably a Be star, although unclear whether pre-MS or post-MS
  + See Martayan-2010j
  + Also Paul:2017t
+ Has lots of lines that show up in the pass band around 6300 \AA
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-084339.png]]
+ The above spectrum shows the globule close to our main source (SSN 152+168) in orange and SSN 73 in yellow
+ In addition to the usual [O I], [S III], Si II, we have lines emission lines at 6247, 6317, 6383
  + Some of these are also seen weekly in our main compact source

**** [O I] 6300, 6363 (+ [S III], Si II)
+ This is done in [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/03-03-oi-lines-sharp-cube.md][03-03-oi-lines-sharp-cube.md]]
+ As well as the [O I] lines, we have [S III] 6312 and Si II 6347 and 6371
  + The Si II lines come from compact sources only
**** [Ar IV] 4711, 4740
+ The 4711 is blended with He I 4713, but we can see the effect of both
+ the 4740 line is great - it is very diffuse, but has an inner hole the same as [O III]
  + This could correspond to the inner wind bubble
**** He II 4686
+ Another great line - it shows a beautiful emission arc just inside the [Ar IV] emission
+ We can calculate the flux and then convert to a > 4 Ryd luminosity and see if this is consistent with expected stellar EUV
+ The arc shows no extinction by the globule filaments, and so must be foreground to them
+ *I need to do this for the summed cube too* to increase signal-noise
* Larger field images from MCELS

+ There are several of these
+ Most are redshifted by 100 to 150 km/s
+ But some are blueshifted too
+ Mostly visible in low-ionization lines such as [S II]
  + In some cases the high-velocity component is as bright as the nebula
+ Probably associated SNR, which may or may not be related to WR binary HD 5980
+ *This has already been well-observed*
  + Danforth:2003m is the most complete study
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210626-234103.png]]
  + Strangely, though they claim there is no low-ionization emission
  + Whereas we see it clearly in [S II]
