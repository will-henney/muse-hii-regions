*** Lines to use for the bow shock
+ [X] He II 4685.71
  + 3-4 transition, so equivalent to Paschen \alpha
+ Lots of [Ar IV] lines!
  + [X] [Ar IV] 4740
  + [-] [Ar IV] 4711
    + Can give density diagnostic *but* it is blended with He I 4713
    + We can try and de-blend it using other helium lines
    + And it looks like the the He I contribution is small
  + [X] [Ar IV] red lines
    + 7170.5 and 7262.7 are clearly detected
      + But not 7237.4 strangely
      + Possibly because of contamination with C II
    + We can calculate a temperature from this!
      + See [[id:8B4C1164-B47D-47BE-9012-7DD0B661E014][[Ar IV] density and T indicators]]
    + Theory of [Ar IV] lines
      + (Ne, Te) diagnostic diagrams given in 
+ [Cl IV] 7530.8 and 8046.3
  + Unfortunately, the ratio gives us nothing since they come from the same upper state (S/N is not good enough to give useful reddening)
  + The auroral line is 5322.99 but it is not detected
  + [X] 7530.8 done, but contaminated by C II 7530.57
    + This is seen in the map, which shows emission from the filaments and clumps
    + The C II emission seems to come from much closer to the ionization front than it does in Orion
    + This is probably an ionization effect - the C^+ column in the ionized gas is much smaller because the spectrum is harder
    + But may also be a contribution of the low metallicity
  + [X] 8046.3
    + Also contaminated
+ He I 4713 - see above
+ [X] Look for other He I lines
  + [X] He I 4921.93
  + He I 5015.68 - on wing of 5007 but not excessively blended
  + [X] He I 5047.74 - weak
  + [X] Use PyNeb to find lines (or combinations of lines) that should be a fixed ratio to 4713, so that we can subtract it.
+ [X] Look for other He II lines
  + *none are usable*
  + 4859.319 (4-8 Br \delta) - completely swamped by H\beta
  + 5411.52 (4-7 Br \gamma), which coincides with [Fe III]. Although that should not be a problem because there is no [Fe III] from the bow shock region (see below)
    + But it shows no emission - just photospheric absorption 
  + 6560.1 (4-6 Br \beta)
    + Probably too blended with H\alpha
+ [X] [Ar III] 5193.69
  - very weak and diffuse
  - does not seem to show any peak at the bow shock
  - T indicator with red [Ar III] line
+ [X] [Ar III] 7135.78
+ [X] H\alpha and H\beta to get reddening
  + [X] Extract line maps
  + [X] Fine correction for zero point offset
  + [X] Calculate reddening
    + We have a reddening map [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/data/ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits][ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits]]
    + Average reddening of bow shock region is E(B-V) = 0.087
    + We have a SMC reddening curve that we calculate from pyneb using parameters from Gordon:2003l
    + I am ignoring the stellar absorption EW for now, but that needs to be dealt with if we ever look at more reddened regions. 
+ [X] [S III] lines for temperature
+ [X] [Cl III] lines for density
  + These are rubbish, unfortunately.  Signal-to-noise is too low to say anything at all
+ [ ] [S II] lines for density
  + This works much better - s/n is high and we are clearly away from the low-density limit
  + We can distinguish the denser gas close to ionization fronts on filaments from the lower-density diffuse component
    + The latter has densities of order 
**** Lines that that do NOT come from bow shock
+ [Fe III] 4987.20 - has broad range of emission, but concentrated in the E of the field
+ [Fe III] 4658.1 - weaker than 4987, but similar distribution
  + Except for the mYSO, where it is super-bright
+ Lots of other [Fe III] and [Fe II] lines that only show up in the mYSO
+ Si II 5041.03 - mYSO and SE clump (which may be another mYSO)
+ [N I] 5200 comes from filaments and clumps, but not from ionized gas

:END:
+ The projected area around W 3 shows
  + small arc in He II
  + larger but still centrally-concentrated arc in [Ar IV]
  + no particular concentration in [O III], He I, [Ar III], H I, etc
+ This suggests that the ionizing illumination is dominated by W 3 for E > 40.735 eV
  + But it does not dominate the illumination for E = 35 \to 40.735 eV or any of the softer bands
+ From the ACS H\alpha image, there is small region that shows the bow shell cleanly
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210614-130218.png]]
  Between about 3 and 7 arcsec from W3.  Beyond this, the globules start to dominate the H alpha and other medium ionization lines
***** Ionization balance of Ar
+ We should have
  \[
  \frac{Ar^{3+}}{Ar^{2+}} =
  \frac{F \sigma}{\alpha n_e}
  \]
  + F is the ionizing flux for h\nu > 40.7 eV
  + \sigma is the Ar^{2+} photoionization cross section
  + \alpha is the Ar^{3+} recombination rate
+ Assume constant T and that F only varies by geometrical dilution: F ~ 1/R^2
  +

+ From just visual inspection of the spectra I get
  | 4711.37 |  85 |
  | 4740.17 |  60 |
  |  7170.5 |   3 |
  |  7237.4 | 3.5 |
  |  7262.7 | 2.5 |
+ According to ratios specified by Keenan:
  + R_1 = 4711.37 /  4740.17 = 1.417 -> 0.1513 on log scale
    + This is low-density limit
    + In principle there may be some contamination by He I
      + But even if the density is high as 200 or so, there is hardly any effect on the temperature diagnostics
  + R_2 = 7238 / (4711 + 4730) = 3.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.02414 -> -1.617
    + implies T a bit bigger than 20,000 K !!!
    + *this one is bad* it is contaminated by C II 7236.19 or something
      + The map shows that most of the emission comes from the filament not from the bow shock
  + R_3 = 7263 / (4711 + 4730) =  2.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.01724 -> -1.763
    + gives T = 17500 K, approx
  + R_4 = 7171 / (4711 + 4730) = 3 / (60 + 85) = 0.02069 -> -1.684
    + but theoretically R_4 / R_2 = 1.33
    + We find R_4/R_2 = 7171 / 7238 = 3 / 3.5 = 0.8571, which must be due to contamination of 7238
    + So assuming R_2 = R_4 / 1.33, then R_2 = 0.02069 / 1.33 = 0.01556 -> -1.808
      + gives 17500 K, same as R_3
  + *Conclusion* Both R_3 and R_4 imply 17,500 K, while R_2 is hopelessly contaminated
  + *Except* I have not included the reddening

+ T_eff = 55000 K or 51000 K with an alternative solution
+ Wind parameters:
  + Mdot = 2.5e-6 Msun/yr
    + I no longer have faith in this value.
    + Supposedly it is from the Ha and He II 4686 lines, but these are not well produced by the Fastwind models.
      + The model predicts emission in the wings of the He II line, which is not seen at all
        [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-122838.png]]
      + Green is the observations.  Red, blue, black is different T_eff models. Red is supposedly the average of blue (cooler) and black (hotter), so it is odd that it does not lie between them.
      + Also the POWR models give He II 4686 emission for the high mass-loss case (SMC-OB-III grid)
    + Observed He II line from W3 from MUSE:
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130804.png]]
    + Same for W1 (O4 If+)
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130853.png]]
    + So W1 has clear wind signature in the He II line
      + A velocity of 2000 km/s is \Delta\lambda = 31 \AA at 4686
      + The wings go from 4667 to 4710 -> +/- 20 \AA -> +/- 1280 km/s
    + [X] But note that they both have broad bumps in the wings of the H\beta line
      + *I now think these are not real*
        + I looked at the original spectra, and I think it is more likely to be a broad absorption feature around 4750 that has thrown off the continuum fit
        + Orion stars show the same, see Simon-Diaz paper
        + Might be some broad DIB
      + These don't seem to be predicted by any of the atmosphere models
      + /Could they be Raman scattering?/
        + No I don't think so
      + 4809 to 4919 \AA in H\beta -> +/- 55 \AA -> +/- 3000 km/s
      + Seems a bit excessive to be a velocity
  + Vw = 2800 km/s
  + Ram pressure at 1 pc
    + \rho V^2 = Mdot V / 4 \pi R^2
    + => = 3.687e-10 dyne / cm^2
    + P_ram / k = 2.67e6
  + Compare with thermal pressure of H II gas
    + P_gas / k = 2 n T
    + Assume T = 1e4 K => n = 135 pcc
    + This is well in line with measurements
      + *No it is not* [2021-06-12 Sat 09:22]
      + I now get a much lower density than this: 11 pcc
  + We could also have a ram pressure component, so multiply by 1 + M^2
    + We can't have M much larger than 1, otherwise the density would have to be too low
+ We can estimate the density from the surface brightness of He II
**** Atmosphere models for W3
+ The POWR OB models only go up to 50,000 K
  + This is just about acceptable if we take the lower T solution from Rivero-Gonzalez
+ There are 3 sets of SMC O star models with different wind strengths
+ I am first looking at the intermediate set

    2. [ ] Or, we could just rebin to a common RA, Dec grid.
       - Since, then we can simply sum along the y direction.
       - This would also allow us to calculate ratios
       - Seems like the best bet

** General thoughts
+ Properties of N66 from Lopez:2014a
  + Q(H) = 4e50 /s = 40 x Orion
  + n = 100 pcc = 0.03 x Orion
    + In both cases there are large variations, however
  + R = 64 pc = 30 x Orion
  + *therefore* (n R) and (Q n) are both similar to Orion, so ionization parameter is similar too
*** Comparison of size scales and luminosities between Orion and SMC

    + This is only 0.5 mag brighter than th1C, so probably O6V
  + Sun has M_V = +4.81 => V = 23.76

*** Ionizing stars in N66

**** Contribution of the WR+WR binary HD 5980
+ Considerable variation over last 20 years
+ *Conclusions*
  + For the low state, we have Q_0 = 1e50 approx
  + And a very low Q_2 (so no ionizing to He II)
+ High state (1994):
  + log L = 6.6
  + T_* = 47 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 111e-5
  + Vinf = 750 km/s
  + R_10 = 28 Rsun
+ Low state (2014):
  + log L = 6.23
  + T_* = 48 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 14e-5
  + Vinf = 2100 km/s
  + R_10 = 19 Rsun
+ Transformation for POWR models
  - All their models are for nominal log L = 5.3
  - They use a transformed radius: R_t = R_* (V_inf / 2500 km/s)^{2/3} (Mdot sqrt(D) / 1e-4)^{-2/3}
    - where D = 1/f is clumping factor
  - For a different luminosity, we must rescale R_* as L^{1/2}
  - And Mdot scales as L^{3/4}
  - So we have:
    - High state:
      - R_* = 28 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.6)) = 6.268 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((750/2500)/ (11.1))**(2/3) = 0.09 6.268 = 0.56412 Rsun => -0.248 on log10 scale
        - Unfortunately, that is off the bottom of the grid!
    - Low state:
      - Luminosity is 10**(6.23 - 5.3) = 8.5 times higher than fiducial
      - R_* = 19 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.23)) = 6.513 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((2100/2500)/ (1.4))**(2/3) = 0.7114 6.513 = 4.633 Rsun => 0.6659 on log 10 scale
+ So for the low state, the closest model is 06-14: T = 44.7 kK, log Rt = 0.7
  + This comes with R_* = 7.5 => rescaled: 7.5 sqrt(8.5) = 21.9 Rsun
    + (close enough to 19)
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.01, 47.69, 0.00, 45.77 - so very soft
    + Rescaled back to real luminosity: Q_0 = 49.01 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 49.94
  + Mdot = -4.23 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.23) = 2.93e-4
    + this is not entirely consistent with the original 1.4e-4
  + V = 1600 km/s
+ We should also look at the closest hotter model 07-13: T = 50000 K, log Rt = 0.8
  + R_* = 5.9 => rescaled: 5.9 sqrt(8.5) = 17 Rsun
    + So this model and the previous one nicely bracket 19 Rsun
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.09, 48.47, 36.46, 47.42 - so not so soft, but still almost no He+ ionizing radiation
    + Rescaled ionizing luminosity: 49.09 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 50.02
  + Mdot = -4.53 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.53) = 1.47e-4
    + Very close to original

+ M_bol = V + BC - AV - DM
  + DM = 18.95
  + AV = 0.3 approx (assuming E(B-V) = 0.1)
  + I have added an extra 1 mag extinction by hand to SSN 168
+ L/Lsun = 10**(0.4 (M_sun - M_bol))
  + M_sun = 4.73
+ R = sqrt(L / 4 \pi \sigma T^4)
+ So in terms of bolometric flux, the nearby B star totally dominates
+ But we should work out the external luminosity incident on the globule
  + And not include SSN 168 since that is on the inside
  + Sum over stars of luminosity x area covering fraction: \sum_i L_i \Omega_i / 4\pi
  + \Omega_i / 4\pi = A_glob / 4\pi d^2 = \pi r_glob^2 / 4\pi d^2 = r_glob^2 / 4 d^2
  + Take r_glob = 1 arcsec
+ The result is a total of 1.3e4 Lsun, of which half comes from W 2
+ So this is less than the inner luminosity from SSN 168 (3e4), if that was all trapped
  + Also, the external luminosities are upper limits, assuming that everything is in the plane of the sky
+ I have done the same for the ionizing luminosity
  + I get a total external incident luminosity of Q_ext = 6.3e47 s^-1
  + As opposed to an internal luminosity from the B0V star of 4e47 s^-1
  + The external incident luminosity is split up as follows
    + 40% from W 2
    + 24% from W 1
    + 17% from SSN 22
    + 6% from W 3
    + 13% from the rest (each 3% or less)
+ [ ] Now, we need to compare this with the Ha luminosity of the globule and of the inner sources
***** Relative contributions to the global ionization balance
+ The list above has all the stars with Q_0 > 5e48 I think
  + Except for some more that a long way to S or N
+ Total luminosity is 4.3e50
  + Could be 5.3e50 if we add in both WR stars as equals
  + Lopez:2014a give 50.6 -> 4e50
    + This is based on a simple conversion of the H\alpha luminosity of log L(Ha) = 38.6
    + [ ] We should compare that with the flux measured in our MUSE field
      + 
  
+ Recombination time:
  + Dense gas:
    + n_e = 100 pcc
    + \alpha \approx 2e-13
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1600 years
  + He II gas
    + n_e = 11 pcc
    + \alpha = 1.5e-12
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1920 years
  + So almost the same!  The lower density is compensated by a higher recombination rate
  + So recomb timescale of a few thousand years is small compared with stellar evolution timescale, even for WR stars
+ 
***** Conversion of spectral type to ionizing luminosity
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ Galactic case is done by Martins:2005a
  + Application to Carina in Smith:2006a
  + But what about the SMC abundances?
****** Spectral type to effective temperature
+ Massey:2005z show the S. Type - T_eff relations for MW vs SMC
  file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210527-134032.png
  + They find that SMC stars a bit hotter (green line) for both supergiants and dwarfs
  + I have inserted these temperatures as a column in the above table
+ [ ] But what about bespoke stellar parameter determinations?
  + Massey:2000l have
    + Q = (U - B) - 0.72 (B - V)
    + This is supposedly a reddening-free index
    + Then 
      - For Q < -0.6 and either (B - V)_0 < 0.0 or (U - B)_0 < -0.6,
      - log Teff = 4.2622 + 0.64525 Q + 1.09174 Q^2, (V)
      - log Teff = 5.2618 + 3.42004 Q + 2.93489 Q^2, (III)
      - log Teff = -0.9894 - 22.767380 Q -  33.09637 Q^2 16.19307 Q^3 (I)
  + However, I can't be bothered to look up all the UBV photometry necessary to do this
****** Luminosities, radii
+ We need the gravity to get the q_1 ionizing flux from the stellar atmosphere
  + function of T_eff, g, Z
+ But then we need the R to convert to luminosity Q_1
+ But we also have L_bol = 4 \pi R^2 T_eff^4
  + And we can find L_bol from M_V and bolometric correction
  + BC is known as a function of T_eff
    + E.g., BC = -6.90 log Teff + 27.99
    + Massey:2005z, equation (2)
    + From this, we can calculate the radii from M_V
      + If we know A_V
+ This is done in the table
****** Masses, gravity
+ [ ] The gravity should have a calibration with luminosity class
****** Ionizing fluxes
+ If the fluxes q_0 are not a strong function of g, then we don't need to find the gravity
+ We can use the same q_0 as in Martins:2005a, but using our T_eff, rather than their Galactic calibration
+ Apparently, the direct effect of metallicity on q_0 is small, but q_1 should be higher at lower metallicities
  + Quote regarding this from Martins:2005a section 6:
    : From the modelling side, Kudritzki (2002) and Mokiem et al. (2004)
    : have investigated the effect of a change of the metal content on the
    : spectral energy distribution of O dwarfs using CMFGEN models. They
    : found that H ionising fluxes are essentially unchanged when Z is
    : varied between twice and one tenth the solar content. They argue that
    : the redistribution of the flux blocked by metals at short wavelengths
    : takes place within the Lyman continuum, which explains the observed
    : behaviour. However, they show that the SEDs are strongly modified
    : below ~450 \AA, spectra being softer at higher metallicity (see also
    : Sect. 5.3.1). Morisset et al. (2004) have computed various WM-BASIC
    : models at different metallicities and showed how Z affected the
    : strength of mid-IR nebular lines emitted in compact H I regions. The
    : softening of the SEDs when metallicity increases is crucial to
    : understand the behaviour of observed excitation sequences.
***** Helium-plus ionizing luminosities 
+ This is important for the bow shock ionization
+ We are also interested in the ionization of Ar III -> Ar IV
  + This requires 40.735 eV, compared with 35.121 eV for O III and 54.418 eV for He II
  + Ar IV can persist in the He II zone since Ar IV -> V requires 59.58 eV
****** Consistency check on the ionization fraction and thickness of the He II zone
+ Based on the notebook [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.md]]
+ There I find that Q_2 = 4.7e45 /s
+ And I also found that n_e = 11 /cm^3
+ The distance of the inner edge from the star is 4 arcsec = 9.23e+17 cm = 0.3 pc
+ So the ionizing flux is F = Q / 4 \pi R^2 = 4.39e+08 phot/s/cm^2
+ This should be equal to n_e n_i \alpha_B h = y_He n_e^2 \alpha_B h / (1 + 2 y_He)
  + Assuming y_He = 0.082 and \alpha_B = 1.533e-12 cm^3/s
  + h = F / y_He n_e^2 \alpha_B = 4.39e+08 / 0.082 11**2 1.533e-12 = 2.886e+19 cm = 9.353 pc
  + That would be 120 arcsec, which is way too thick
  + Which suggests that I have made a mistake somewhere

****** Correction for radius
+ The POWR models are a bit sub-luminous compared with W3
  + SMC-OB-I 50-42 has log L = 5.76
  + W3 has log L = 5.98 (cooler) to 6.08 (hotter)
  + Take the cooler one to start with, for consistency with the POWR Teff
  + So to rescale all the luminosities, we would add 0.22 in log space
  + Each model has a different nominal luminosity, so I am going to have to add in
+ Scaling of Mdot when luminosity is adjusted
  + Q = Mdot D^{1/2} (Rstar Vinf)^{-3/2}
    + where D is the clumping factor (D = 1/f) at 10 R_*
      + clumping increases gradually from sonic point to 10 R_*
    + all models assume D = 10

    + Although in some places it says -13.5, -12.5, -14.5
    + But that is using a different definition of Q that does not include the sqrt(D) factor 
  + Work through for SMC-OB-II 50-42
    + R_STAR = 10.137 R_SUN
    + V = 3020 km/s
    + log M_dot = -5.771
    + D = 10
    + => log Q = log10(sqrt(10) 10**-5.771 (10.137 3020)**(-3/2)) = -12.0


***** TODO What is this "excitation parameter" that the early papers mention?
+ It has units of pc cm^-2, which is length

*** What to call the stars?
+ My current plan is just to use the Sabbi ID numbers, which are in order of V brightness
  + SIMBAD says:
    : dic: Table 2: <Cl* NGC 346 SSN NNNNNN> N=79960 among (Nos 1-132733). Table 3: <[SSN2007] Sc NN> (Nos 1-16).
  + So I can just abbreviate it as SSN 152, SSN 168, etc
+ Alternative lists:
  + MPG gets used a lot

*** Different components of mYSO C
+ There are two continuum sources, presumably stars
  + Separated by about 0.3 arcsec
  + Sabbi ID 152 and 168
    + MPG 454 corresponds to both of them
  + The NE source 
    + Sabbi ID 152
+ Other correspondences
  + SSTS3MC 14.7725-72.1766 from Simon:2007r
    + They estimate 3.4e4 Lsun and 15 Msun
    + Their source includes both stars
  + Contursi:2000f give spectrum (their Peak C in Fig 6)
    + They estimate G_0 = 8.7e5
    + [ ] *We can use this to get a distance from the star maybe*
  + Whelan:2013d source PS 9
    + Spectrum is different from other sources
    + Prominent Silicate emission
    + Strangely low PAH 7.7/11.3 ratio although normal 6.2/11.3 ratio
  + Sewio:2013f
    + Source Y535
  + Rubio:2018f have the most comprehensive study
    + They have near-IR imaging and spectra
    + And they compare with the literature measurements 
*** SED modelling of the YSOs
+ Robitaille:2006f is what everyone uses
+ Although Zhang:2018k claim their models are more physically consistent
*** Massive YSOs in other regions

+ van-Gelder:2020z do X-shooter spectroscopy of sources in the LMC
  + Their Fig 13 shows Br\gamma luminosity vs K-band magnitude for a whole bunch of sources from MW, SMC, and LMC: 
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210524-110837.png]]
  + The ones that are way above the trend line might be good candidates for looking for Raman scattering
  + The SMC sources are in this category: relatively bright in Br\gamma
    + For Source C, observed K_S = 12.05, meaning M_K = 12.05 - 18.95 = -6.9
    + This means it must be the rightmost orange square, so L(Br\gamma) = 30 L_\odot, which corresponds to Q(H) = 8.554e+48 /s (see conversion factor from below)
    + So that would be like an O7V star if 100% covering factor
    + [0/2] But some questions remain?
      + [ ] How is Br\gamma flux apportioned between different components (two compact sources plus surrounding globule)?
        + This could be addressed by using the H\alpha fluxes from HST and/or MUSE
      + [ ] How feasible is external, rather than internal illumination?
        + For the globule it must be external because of the ionization gradient (seen in [O III] compared with H\alpha for instance)
  + Conversion of Br\gamma to other measures:
    + Br\gamma is 7 \to 4 transition
    + Equivalent H\beta
      + Table 4.2 of Osterbrock book has j(Br\gamma) / j(H\beta) = 0.0281
        + For T = 1e4 K in low-density limit
      + So 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma means 35.6 L_\odot of H\beta
    + Equivalent H\alpha
      + j(H\alpha) / j(H\beta) = 2.87
      + => 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma = 102.1 L_\odot of H\alpha
      + That is worth remembering: *H\alpha / Br\gamma = 100* more or less
    + Equivalent Q(H)
      + L(H\beta) = e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) VEM
      + Q(H) = \alpha_B VEM
      + => Q(H) = [\alpha_B / e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta)] L(H\beta)
      + \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
      + e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) = 1.24e-25 erg cm^3/s
        + (This is 4\pi j(H\beta) / n_e n_p in the Osterbrock table)
      + => Q(H) = (2.6e-13 / 1.24e-25) 35.6 3.82e33 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + => Q(H) = 2.85e+47 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + Remember, this is assuming 100% area covering fraction of ionization-bounded matter (no escape) and no EUV absorbed by dust.
        + So it is a lower limit on Q(H)
    + So th1C would be way above the line, at M_K, L(Br\gamma) = -3.6, 30
      + *but* that is assuming all ionizing photons trapped nearby
      + In reality, Orion S has much lower flux than this would imply
      + [ ] /need to calculate H\alpha flux from Orion S/

    + McCaughrean:2002a
    + Hester:1996w
      + R = 300 to 1000 AU = 1.5 to 5 mpc

** Analysis of Raman wings of SMC N66 mYSO C
+ Optically thick out past 100 \AA
  + Must have column of > 1e22 H^0 / cm^2
  + Suggests low dust cross section
*** What we need for a paper
+ Spectrum of Raman wings
  + Obviously Ha
  + But also look at Hb too
+ Deal with the sky problems
  + Nebular over-subtraction
    + Puts the emission lines in absorption in the faint regions
  + Telluric over-division
    + Puts telluric absorption bands in emission in spectra of bright stars
+ Spatial profiles in wings, continuum, Ha, [S II], [O III]
  + When is it spatially resolved and when not?
+ Look at more lines
  + [S III] and [Ar III] to see if they look more like Ha (central peak) or like [O III] (hole in middle)
  + Extinction from Ha/Hb - does the core of the line have nebular extinction (very small) or stellar extinction (A_V = 2.5)?
+ Density/temperature diagnostics
  + We have an [S II] density, but in the presence of gradients/inhomogeneities that will be biased towards low densities
  + Can we get any [Fe III] densities?
    + Mabel used 4986 / 4658
+ Kinematics
  + Local maximum in sigma(Ha) - but is that the line core, or the effect of the Raman wings?
+ Analysis
  + Optical depth of Raman scattering
    + Does it require dust destruction?
  + General thoughts on the young cluster
    + many of the stars seem to be aligned in chains
    + there is a 3-pronged "bird foot" pattern coming out of the brightest compact sub-cluster
    + the chains are approximately aligned with the filaments seen in the gas
*** Going through the lines we need

**** Stars of moderate interest

***** SSN 258
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ This is the slightly fainter star below SSN 62 in the globule just N of our main source
+ It is not in SIMBAD but has V = 17.26 (M_V = -1.69) and V-I = 0.167
  + That puts it around B4 spectral type according to Fig 5 of Martayan:2010j
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-121509.png]]
+ It has strong [N I] 5200 line emission
  + Possible spatially extended, but not much
+ Also shows Si II 5056
***** SSN 552
+ This one is just outside the cluster box in the star figures
+ In a globule
+ It is quite faint and red
  + V = 18.217, V-I = 0.616
+ Shows the Si II 5056, 5041 line but not much else

  + Probably a Be star, although unclear whether pre-MS or post-MS
  + See Martayan-2010j

+ Has lots of lines that show up in the pass band around 6300 \AA
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-084339.png]]
+ The above spectrum shows the globule close to our main source (SSN 152+168) in orange and SSN 73 in yellow
+ In addition to the usual [O I], [S III], Si II, we have lines emission lines at 6247, 6317, 6383
  + Some of these are also seen weekly in our main compact source

**** [O I] 6300, 6363 (+ [S III], Si II)
+ This is done in [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/03-03-oi-lines-sharp-cube.md][03-03-oi-lines-sharp-cube.md]]
+ As well as the [O I] lines, we have [S III] 6312 and Si II 6347 and 6371
  + The Si II lines come from compact sources only
**** [Ar IV] 4711, 4740
+ The 4711 is blended with He I 4713, but we can see the effect of both
+ the 4740 line is great - it is very diffuse, but has an inner hole the same as [O III]
  + This could correspond to the inner wind bubble
**** He II 4686
+ Another great line - it shows a beautiful emission arc just inside the [Ar IV] emission
+ We can calculate the flux and then convert to a > 4 Ryd luminosity and see if this is consistent with expected stellar EUV
+ The arc shows no extinction by the globule filaments, and so must be foreground to them
+ *I need to do this for the summed cube too* to increase signal-noise
* Other things in the FORS1 spectra
** High velocity knots
