+ The Giant Raman Wing Star
  + 0:59:05.1826 -72:10:35.340
  + This is mYSO-C in Rubio:2018a
    + A_V = 2.5 +/- 1
    + log T_eff / K = 4.5 +0.1 -0.2
    + log L / L_sun = 5.1 \pm 0.25
    + Mass = 26 \pm 5 M_sun
    + Log Age / yr = 4.25 \pm 1.0

** General thoughts
+ Properties of N66 from Lopez:2014a
  + Q(H) = 4e50 /s = 40 x Orion
  + n = 100 pcc = 0.03 x Orion
    + In both cases there are large variations, however
  + R = 64 pc = 30 x Orion
  + *therefore* (n R) and (Q n) are both similar to Orion, so ionization parameter is similar too
*** Comparison of size scales and luminosities between Orion and SMC
+ SMC distance: 61.7 kpc
  + Distance modulus: 5 log10(D/10 pc) = 18.95 
+ Orion
  + Distance: 410 pc => 150 times closer
    + Distance modulus: 5 log10(D/10 pc) = 8.06
  + Size of Orion S region: R = 30 arcsec = 0.06 pc
    + 0.2 arcsec @ SMC = *1 MUSE pixel !!!*
  + Separation between Trapezium stars: about 5 arcsec = 0.01 pc
    + 0.03 arcsec @ SMC
  + Separation of Orion S from theta 1 C: R = 55 arcsec = 0.1 pc
    + 0.4 arcsec @ SMC = 2 pixels
  + Separation of Orion-BNKL from theta 1 C = 75 arcsec = 0.15 pc
    + 0.5 arcsec @ SMS = 2.5 pixels
    + BN and Src I are high-mass protostars in the BNKL region
12.05  + Separation of th2A from th1C: R = 140 arcsec = 0.28 pc
    + 0.93 arcsec @ SMC = 5 pixels
  + Entire region studied in Orion paper: 360 x 270 arcsec
    + 2.4 x 1.8 arcsec @ SMC
+ Orion star magnitudes
  + th1C:
    + V = 5.13
      + A_V = 1.5 approx
      + M_V = 5.13 - 1.5 - 8.06 = -4.43
    + I = 4.73
    + K = 4.57
      + A_K = 0.15 approx
      + M_K = 4.57 - 0.15 - 8.06 = -3.64
+ NGC 346 star magnitudes:

*** Observations of the filaments and star forming regions in N66
+ HST observations of pre-MS population
  + These find several sub-clusters of pre-MS stars
  + Gouliermis:2006h
  + Nota:2006x
  + Sabbi:2007h
    + This has the sub-clusters that I am currently plotting in the figures
    + But it might be better to use the ones from Schmeja instead
    + Or even the ones from IR studies
+ near-IR observations
  + Rubio:2000k present 2.12 H_2 and 2.14 micron continuum
  + They find several "embedded sources"
  + Numbered 1-5 and associated with mid-IR peaks as follows:
    1. Tip of plume
    2. I
    3. D
    4. E
    5. C
+ mid-IR observations
  + Contursi:2000f
    + Find several clumps of PAH emission:
      + labelled A-H
  + Simon:2007r
    + Spitzer
  + Whelan:2013d
    + More Spitzer
+ CO/C I/C II observations
  + Rubio:2000k
    + CO
  + Requena-Torres:2016g
    + Mainly C II but also C I and CO
+ Analysis of clustering/sub-clustering
  + Schmeja:2009q
    + Quote from abstract
      : Several PMS clusters are aligned along filaments of higher stellar density pointing away from the central part of the region.
      + This is exactly what I had spotted in the star distribution
+ Optical UBV observations
  + 
*** Different components of mYSO C
+ There are two continuum sources, presumably stars
  + Separated by about 0.5 arcsec
+ The NE source
  + This is MPG454
+ Other correspondences
  + SSTS3MC 14.7725-72.1766 from Simon:2007r
    + They estimate 3.4e4 Lsun and 15 Msun
    + Their source includes both stars
  + Contursi:2000f give spectrum (their Peak C in Fig 6)
    + They estimate G_0 = 8.7e5
    + [ ] *We can use this to get a distance from the star maybe*
  + Whelan:2013d source PS 9
    + Spectrum is different from other sources
    + Prominent Silicate emission
    + Strangely low PAH 7.7/11.3 ratio although normal 6.2/11.3 ratio

+ van-Gelder:2020z do X-shooter spectroscopy of sources in the LMC
  + Their Fig 13 shows Br\gamma luminosity vs K-band magnitude for a whole bunch of sources from MW, SMC, and LMC: 
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210524-110837.png]]
  + The ones that are way above the trend line might be good candidates for looking for Raman scattering
  + The SMC sources are in this category: relatively bright in Br\gamma
    + For Source C, observed K_S = 12.05, meaning M_K = 12.05 - 18.95 = -6.9
    + This means it must be the rightmost orange square, so L(Br\gamma) = 30 L_\odot, which corresponds to Q(H) = 8.554e+48 /s (see conversion factor from below)
    + So that would be like an O7V star if 100% covering factor
    + [0/2] But some questions remain?
      + [ ] How is Br\gamma flux apportioned between different components (two compact sources plus surrounding globule)?
        + This could be addressed by using the H\alpha fluxes from HST and/or MUSE
      + [ ] How feasible is external, rather than internal illumination?
        + For the globule it must be external because of the ionization gradient (seen in [O III] compared with H\alpha for instance)
  + Conversion of Br\gamma to other measures:
    + Br\gamma is 7 \to 4 transition
    + Equivalent H\beta
      + Table 4.2 of Osterbrock book has j(Br\gamma) / j(H\beta) = 0.0281
        + For T = 1e4 K in low-density limit
      + So 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma means 35.6 L_\odot of H\beta
    + Equivalent H\alpha
      + j(H\alpha) / j(H\beta) = 2.87
      + => 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma = 102.1 L_\odot of H\alpha
      + That is worth remembering: *H\alpha / Br\gamma = 100* more or less
    + Equivalent Q(H)
      + L(H\beta) = e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) VEM
      + Q(H) = \alpha_B VEM
      + => Q(H) = [\alpha_B / e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta)] L(H\beta)
      + \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
      + e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) = 1.24e-25 erg cm^3/s
        + (This is 4\pi j(H\beta) / n_e n_p in the Osterbrock table)
      + => Q(H) = (2.6e-13 / 1.24e-25) 35.6 3.82e33 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + => Q(H) = 2.85e+47 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + Remember, this is assuming 100% area covering fraction of ionization-bounded matter (no escape) and no EUV absorbed by dust.
        + So it is a lower limit on Q(H)
    + So th1C would be way above the line, at M_K, L(Br\gamma) = -3.6, 30
      + *but* that is assuming all ionizing photons trapped nearby
      + In reality, Orion S has much lower flux than this would imply
      + [ ] /need to calculate H\alpha flux from Orion S/

+ [[attachment:CleanShot 2021-05-24 at 13.51.30@2x.png][Possible jets seen in H alpha ACS image]]
  + Note: I used the standard org-attach method to attach this screenshot, which I made with CleanShot because I wanted to annotate it
  + This has the disadvantage that the link is not a normal image link
+ [ ] Look at evidence from the MUSE spectra for high-velocity H\alpha
  + I think there was some indication to the N of the embedded sources
** Analysis of Raman wings of SMC N66 mYSO C
+ Optically thick out past 100 \AA
  + Must have column of > 1e22 H^0 / cm^2
  + Suggests low dust cross section
*** What we need for a paper
+ Spectrum of Raman wings
  + Obviously Ha
  + But also look at Hb too
+ Deal with the sky problems
  + Nebular over-subtraction
    + Puts the emission lines in absorption in the faint regions
  + Telluric over-division
    + Puts telluric absorption bands in emission in spectra of bright stars
+ Spatial profiles in wings, continuum, Ha, [S II], [O III]
  + When is it spatially resolved and when not?
+ Look at more lines
  + [S III] and [Ar III] to see if they look more like Ha (central peak) or like [O III] (hole in middle)
  + Extinction from Ha/Hb - does the core of the line have nebular extinction (very small) or stellar extinction (A_V = 2.5)?
+ Density/temperature diagnostics
  + We have an [S II] density, but in the presence of gradients/inhomogeneities that will be biased towards low densities
  + Can we get any [Fe III] densities?
    + Mabel used 4986 / 4658
+ Kinematics
  + Local maximum in sigma(Ha) - but is that the line core, or the effect of the Raman wings?
+ Analysis
  + Optical depth of Raman scattering
    + Does it require dust destruction?
  + General thoughts on the young cluster
    + many of the stars seem to be aligned in chains
    + there is a 3-pronged "bird foot" pattern coming out of the brightest compact sub-cluster
    + the chains are approximately aligned with the filaments seen in the gas
