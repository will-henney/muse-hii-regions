* MUSE cube of N66/NGC 346 in the SMC


** Compact sources of interest
+ The Giant Raman Wing Star
  + 0:59:05.1826 -72:10:35.340
  + This is mYSO-C in Rubio:2018a
    + A_V = 2.5 +/- 1
    + log T_eff / K = 4.5 +0.1 -0.2
    + log L / L_sun = 5.1 \pm 0.25
    + Mass = 26 \pm 5 M_sun
    + Log Age / yr = 4.25 \pm 1.0
    + Class I (massive protostellar disk)

** Lines of interest
+ Still to do:
  + [O I] 6300, 6363
  + [S III] 6312, 9069
  + O I 8446
  + [Cl IV] 8045
  + [C I] 8727
  + [Fe III]
** General thoughts
+ Properties of N66 from Lopez:2014a
  + Q(H) = 4e50 /s = 40 x Orion
  + n = 100 pcc = 0.03 x Orion
    + In both cases there are large variations, however
  + R = 64 pc = 30 x Orion
  + *therefore* (n R) and (Q n) are both similar to Orion, so ionization parameter is similar too
*** Comparison of size scales between Orion and SMC
+ SMC distance: 61.7 kpc
+ Orion
  + Distance: 410 pc => 150 times closer
  + Size of Orion S region: R = 30 arcsec = 0.06 pc
    + 0.2 arcsec @ SMC = *1 MUSE pixel !!!*
  + Separation between Trapezium stars: about 5 arcsec = 0.01 pc
    + 0.03 arcsec @ SMC
  + Separation of Orion S from theta 1 C: R = 55 arcsec = 0.1 pc
    + 0.4 arcsec @ SMC = 2 pixels
  + Separation of th2A from th1C: R = 140 arcsec = 0.28 pc
    + 0.93 arcsec @ SMC = 5 pixels
  + Entire region studied in Orion paper: 360 x 270 arcsec
    + 2.4 x 1.8 arcsec @ SMC
*** Observations of the filaments and star forming regions in N66
+ HST observations of pre-MS population
  + These find several sub-clusters of pre-MS stars
  + Gouliermis:2006h
  + Nota
+ ISO observations
  + Contursi:2000f
  + Find several clumps of PAH emission:
    + 
+ CO observations
  + Rubio:2000k

** Analysis of Raman wings of SMC N66 mYSO C
+ Optically thick out past 100 \AA
  + Must have column of > 1e22 H^0 / cm^2
  + Suggests low dust cross section
*** What we need for a paper
+ Spectrum of Raman wings
  + Obviously Ha
  + But also look at Hb too
+ Deal with the sky problems
  + Nebular over-subtraction
    + Puts the emission lines in absorption in the faint regions
  + Telluric over-division
    + Puts telluric absorption bands in emission in spectra of bright stars
+ Spatial profiles in wings, continuum, Ha, [S II], [O III]
  + When is it spatially resolved and when not?
+ Look at more lines
  + [S III] and [Ar III] to see if they look more like Ha (central peak) or like [O III] (hole in middle)
  + Extinction from Ha/Hb - does the core of the line have nebular extinction (very small) or stellar extinction (A_V = 2.5)?
+ Density/temperature diagnostics
  + We have an [S II] density, but in the presence of gradients/inhomogeneities that will be biased towards low densities
  + Can we get any [Fe III] densities?
    + Mabel used 4986 / 4658
+ Kinematics
  + Local maximum in sigma(Ha) - but is that the line core, or the effect of the Raman wings?
+ Analysis
  + Optical depth of Raman scattering
    + Does it require dust destruction?
  + General thoughts on the young cluster
    + many of the stars seem to be aligned in chains
    + there is a 3-pronged "bird foot" pattern coming out of the brightest compact sub-cluster
    + the chains are approximately aligned with the filaments seen in the gas
