* MUSE cube of N66/NGC 346 in the SMC


** Compact sources of interest
+ The Giant Raman Wing Star
  + 0:59:05.1826 -72:10:35.340
  + This is mYSO-C in Rubio:2018a
    + A_V = 2.5 +/- 1
    + log T_eff / K = 4.5 +0.1 -0.2
    + log L / L_sun = 5.1 \pm 0.25
    + Mass = 26 \pm 5 M_sun
    + Log Age / yr = 4.25 \pm 1.0
    + Class I (massive protostellar disk)

** Lines of interest
+ Still to do:
  + [O I] 6300, 6363
  + [S III] 6312, 9069
  + O I 8446
  + [Cl IV] 8045
  + [C I] 8727
** Analysis of Raman wings of N66 mYSO C
+ Optically thick out past 100 \AA
  + Must have column of > 1e22 H^0 / cm^2
  + Suggests low dust cross section
