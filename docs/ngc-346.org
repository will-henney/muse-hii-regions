  + That is, center of the MUSE field
  + SSN 17
  + 0:59:02.9347 -72:10:34.976
  + It has a mini star cluster around it (Sc 2)

  + Star is 1 arcsec south of SSN 62 (O9V), which is probably unrelated foreground
  + Globule is just 3 arcsec north of W 2 (O8.5III), which is brightest star in central cluster
  + Bright O I 8446 centered on star, which is at head of globule
    + Also cometary tail-like extension along tail of globule
  + Based on Ha brightness around the edge, globule seems ionized principally from South (by W 2) but also to a lesser extent from the West (similar to the fainter globules to south of Sc 1)

** Deep neutral/molecular lines


*** Possible atomic candidates

**** C I lines
- Although 8727 is recombination in Orion, according to Vladimir, it is more likely to be collisionally excited in most planetary nebulae according to Liu et al. 1995
  - This is because the ratio of (9824 +9850)/8727 is predicted to be around 5 to 10 with recombination, whereas it is observed to be typically 30 in planetary nebulae
- There  are other potential recombination lines mentioned by Liu, but we do not see them in NGC 346
  - Ci M3 3p3 P-3s3 P° at 9089À,
    - strongest component 9094.289
  - M2 3p3 S-3s3 P° at 9642 À
  - and M26 4d3 F°-3p3 D at 7116Ä
    - supposedly strongest component is 7113.180
- I do not see any of those lines.
**** Fe I lines
*** Possible molecular candidates
- Diffuse clouds are known to show optical/IR absorption in lines of CN, C_2, CH, CH+, NH, C_3
  - See Table 2 of Snow:2006e ARAA review
- Emission lines are only seen in comets and the Red Rectangle



**** Molecular line databases
- Best overview paper by far
  - McKemmish:2021z
  - [McK21] Laura K. McKemmish. Molecular diatomic spectroscopy data. WIREs Computational Molecular Science, 11(5):e1520, March 2021.
  - Explains all the different sorts of data sources and calculations. Gives list of all available line lists with advantages ans limitations of each of them
***** ExoMol
- https://www.exomol.com
- This has OH+ lines
  - See Hodges:2017j, Wang:2020g
- I have downloaded some of the data
  - [[file:../molecules/ExoMol/]]
    - for smaller files
    - All the ~.def~ and ~.states~ files
      - CN, CH, C_{2}, NH, OH, OH^{+}, H_{2}
      - Common isotopes only
    - ~.trans~ files where they are smaller than 10 MB
  - [[file:../big-data/ExoMol/]]
    - for big files to keep them out of git
    - ~.trans~ files for C_{2} and CN
    - Opacity files if I ever bother with them
      - So far I only have OH^{+}
      - These assume LTE I think, but might still be useful
**** How to calculate wavelengths
- Although this is interesting to understand, it would be better to use the line lists from modern databases instead. 
- We can use the data from Huber & Herzberg (1979) for calculating the transition energies
  - Earlier version in Appendix of Herzberg (1950)
- The equations to use are in Chapter III of Herzberg (1950)
  #+begin_example
    From the data of Table.39, the positions of the rotational and vibrational levels in any of the electronic states may be derived with the aid of the formulae (III, 116) and (III, 121) or, for multiplet states, of the formulae given in Chapter V. The same data may also be used for a calculation of the potential curves either using the Morse function (III, 98) or more involved functions (see p. 102). Furthermore, from these data the positions of the bands and of the lines within the bands may be derived according to the formulae developed in Chapters III, IV, and V. For the wavelengths of the observed bands of the various molecules, the reader is referred to the extensive tables of Pearse and Gaydon (47).

**** OH lines
- These are a major component of the night sky airglow spectrum
  - Osterbrock:1996a, Osterbrock:1997a
- But SMC is at sufficiently high velocity (+160) that any emission from the nebula should be shifted away from the sky line
- I looked at the
**** Molecular ions
- CH+ is detected by mm emission lines in Orion Bar
  - Nagy:2013a
  - Could it have optical/ir lines too?
    - Yes, see ExoMol section above
- OH- 
**** C_{2} lines
- There is the (2-0) band at 8751, but these are very weak and narrow  when seen in absorption, and are separated by 2 to 4 Angstrom

  - But we see nothing around there at all until 8790
  - Update [2022-10-17 Mon]
    - Mabel has found a possible match for 8809.841
    - But we need to see if any other lines match up
    - [ ] Most pressing question: are these vacuum or air wavelengths?
    - [ ] And where did this table come from?
- More on the C_2 lines [2022-10-17 Mon]
  - Introduction to theory is given in van Dishoek & Black 1982ApJ...258..533V
  - Lines are probably fluorescent
    - Excitation is via the Phillips band system in optical/nir, which is the same one we might be seeing emission lines of
    - Although this makes it hard to see how we can have very bright lines, as compared with the stellar continuum
      - But maybe they are not that bright - we should work out the equivalent widths
  - Excitation is from ground electronic state X to excited electronic state A
    - All these are very approximate
    - The v = 0-0 transition has wn = 8500 => 1.18 micron
      - Interval of about 1500 cm^-1 between vibrational states of A
    - The v = 1-0 transition has wn = 10000 => 1 micron
    - The v = 2-0 transition has wn = 11500 => 8700 \AA
    - The v = 3-0 transition has wn = 13000 => 7690 \AA
    - The v = 4-0 transition has wn = 14500 => 6900 \AA
    - The v = 5-0 transition has wn = 16000 => 6250 \AA
    - Etc ...
    - The v = 8-0 transition has wn = 20500 => 4880 \AA
  - But there is also the rotational structure
  - And we could also have return to a vibrationally excited state of X
    - Interval of about 1800 cm^-1 between vibrational states of X
    - So, for instance 8-3 would be wn = 20500 - 5400 = 15100 => 6620 \AA
- This all looks very promising, as compared to the wavelengths that we have. However, we need to get some precise matches in order to be feasible
**** TODO Finding C_2 wavelengths from ExoMol


  
**** CN lines

- Some in violet, some in IR, but also in far red
- Best recent paper is Syme:2021y
- Seems there is a band that peaks in the Red
  - Lines at 9124.0, 9127.4, seem to close together


**** CH lines
- Data in ExoMol comes from Masseron:2014n but these are all in blue
*** 6400 to 6800 Angstrom
- These are in the same range as the Ha Raman wings
- 6626.5
  - Most clearly molecular by its distribution. The filaments are very sharp
- 6635.5, 6644.5, 6654.5
  - These could be neutral or low ionization, given their distribution
- 6698
  - Weak and moderately diffuse
  - Probably medium ionization
- 6527.5
  - Look like medium ionization
- 6501, 6484.5 (weak)
  - Probably low ionization
- 6458
  - Possibly neutral but weak
- 6594.5 absorption
  - This is seen best in the diffuse Raman zone in the NW
  - It is very broad (10 Angstrom) and a very smooth parabola shape in the summed spectrum

** Details of Raman profiles
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       BA4EBC34-BC84-46ED-90D9-4C4C44EDAC98
:END:
- Most of this is in the globule around mYSO-C
  - All the other emission (for example, from the filaments) is very weak
- [2022-10-26 Wed] I have done new continuum subtractions with a broader window, which work better for the Ha wings
*** Extent of flat top to profile
- This should tell us the wavelength where the profile becomes optically thin
*** Absorption lines

**** The O I lines
- These are seen only in the globule spectrum with any certainty
  - Note that the csub-101 spectrum loses the Raman wings, since they are more than 100 pixels wide
- In other regions, they are too easily confused with the two Deep Neutral UILs on either side of them
**** The Si II line
- This is at 6480.811 \AA rest STP
- Which is 6484.48 with systemic redshift
- We do see absorption at that wavelength in the YSO spectrum
  - Although it is less deep than the O I lines
**** The He II lines
- In the Ha profile, we see absorption at 6545, which may well be the Raman scattered counterpart of He II 1025.272, which is just to the blue of H I 1025.722
  - 6547.4 observed wavelength in YSO means 6543.6 rest optical
    - Difference in wave numbers from Ha is 45.2 /cm
    - Which gives UV wavelength of 1 / (97492.283 + 45.2) = 1025.25, which is close enough
- This line is seen in emission in the PNe NGC 6888 and NGC 6881
  - Choi:2020c
**** The new broad absorptions [2022-10-24 Mon]
- There are many more features in the near Raman wings, which can be seen most clearly around the GLOB-E region, but generally in the neutral gas
- These are the approximate observed wavelengths (rest wavelengths)
  - Red wing 6600 (6596)
    - This is the strongest, with a parabolic shape in the near red wing
    - In the csub-101 cube, the trough has negative values
    - The spatial distribution /seems/ to track the Raman wings
    - But it might just be tracking the shadow of the Ha core emission (the depression halo around the strong line due to subtracting the median-filtered continuum)
    - We should try a 1001 pixel median filter to see if it works better
    - Note that there is maybe even a hint that we are seeing a very shallow version of this in Orion
  - Red wing 6612 (6608)
    - Just a bit further out in the red wing, and might be a bit broader
    - The gap between this one and the last one is classified as a candidate emission line #1603 in the spreadsheet, but if I am right about the two absorption lines, then it is not really an emission line but will just be showing a little bit of the Raman wing.
  - Blue wing XXX
    - There are some genuine emission lines, probably Deep Neutral, which complicate things on this side: #1524 (6505 observed) and #1547 (6534 observed)
    - There may be some absorption here, but it is hard to tell

- This is done in a two-pass filtering with intermediate shaving of emission lines
- Uses the program [[file:../lib/median_continuum.py]]
- Run it in  terminal because it can take a long time
- Example

- Windows that we have tried:
  - 11
  - 101
  - 501
  - 7
- The smaller windows do best for removing the stellar features, which tend to be broader
- But the 501 window is necessary to see the Raman wings
*** DONE [1/1] Step 0: prepare 1D spectra
CLOSED: [2022-10-06 Thu 23:14]
- We can use different samples to get a range of physical conditions
- So far I have
  - The whole cube with masked out stars
  - The region of YSO-C
- I should also do
  - The bow shock
  - One or more samples for the neutral filaments and globules
- Question is, should I background-subtract these or not? Probably not necessary
- It might be easier to just write out spectra once and for all for all the regions
- [X] First, I should combine the regions into one file
  - Actually, there is no need to do this, since the program to make the 1d spectra is accumulatiive

*** DONE Step 1: identify peaks
CLOSED: [2022-10-08 Sat 22:32]
- This uses ~scipy.signal.find_peaks()~
- Various parameters can be tweaked
  - ~prominence~ is height above local baseline
    - Calculated with respect to the higher of the two bases, which are the minima on each of the two sides
    - The positions of the bases are returned as ~right_bases~, ~left_bases~
  - ~distance~ is minimum horizontal distance between peaks in pixels
  - ~width~ is the full width at half-maximum prominence (by default, but can be changed with ~rel_height~ argument)
    - The interpolated positions of the half-maximum points are returned as ~left_ips~ and ~right_ips~
    - In principal, we could use these to look at the asymmetry of the peak
  - Others, that we haven't used yet:
    - ~height~, ~threshold~,

***** Utility function to convert from observed wavelength to rest wavelength
- I set this up as a named source block, so I can call it as a function.
  - The first argument is the observed wavelength.
  - The second argument is the assumed systemic velocity
    - (default of 170 km/s should be close enough for all regions in  NGC 346 field)
      
#+name: rest
#+begin_src python :var wave=6000.0 vsys=170.0 :return rslt

***** Bow shock region
- We use the default parameters, which includes a minimum prominence of 3.0
  - I am hoping that this will be low enough to get all the real lines, but high enough to avoid detecting noise peaks
  - Update [2022-10-08 Sat]: Since we failed to detect a weak [K IV] line I knew should be there, I have run it again with a lower minimum prominence
  - This has now found all the lines I think, but there are also a lot of spurious lines that need to be weeded out
    
#+begin_src sh :dir ../data/spec1d 
python ../../scripts/spec1d-find-peaks.py n346-nostar-bs.fits  --min-prominence 1.0
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: n346-nostar-bs-peaks-p0010-d0030.csv

- With minimum prominence of 3, this has found 101 lines in all
  - Fewer than before, now that I have put restrictions on the width
- With minimum prominence of 1.0, it has found 241 lines
- Let's look at the first few and calculate the rest wavelengths
  - call_rest(4643.6948) {{{results(=4641.065=)}}}
    - This is first of several weak lines, which may or may not be real
    - Maybe it is O II 4641.81, but the wavelength is off by nearly an angstrom, although we would have to look at the mean wavelength to get a more precise estimate
    - It is a particularly broad line: 4.4 pixels, presumably because it is a blend with N II and N III, as in Orion. 
    - Note that the bg-subtracted spectrum in this wave range has some spurious lines, which are due to absorption features in the BG spectrum
      - Maybe we could fix this by moving the bg region a bit
  - call_rest(4652.4448) {{{results(=4649.81=)}}}
    - This is certainly O II 4650
  - call_rest(4688.6948) {{{results(=4686.039=)}}}
    - This one is clearly He II
- Now look for some of the lines that we are expecting
  - call_rest(6104.9448) {{{results(=6101.487=)}}}
    - Clearly a [K IV] line
      : LAB-WAVL-ANG-AIR-|-SPC--|TT|-CONFIGURATION-|TERM-|J_i-J_k|--A_ki---|-TPF-|---LVL-EN--CM-1---|-REF---|
      : 6101.79         [K IV] M1 3s2.3p4-3s2.3p4 3P-1D  2 - 2                     0.00 - 16384.10 029,ASD
      : 6795.1          [K IV] M1 3s2.3p4-3s2.3p4 3P-1D  1 - 2  2.010e-01   ASD 1671.70 - 16384.10 029,ASD

    - However, we do not find the 6795.1 counterpart at this level, so I will try again with a lower minimum prominence
  - call_rest(6798.6948) {{{results(=6794.844=)}}}
    - /Hurray!/ Now we have found the other [K IV] multiplet component
    - Prominence: 1.0637
      - so that is very close to the cut-off
      - still, this is just about the weakest high ionization line that I am expecting
- And other random samples of the lines
  - call_rest(6829.9448) {{{results(=6826.077=)}}}
    - This is the next one after that [K IV] line.
    - I had expected it to be He I 6827.97 but the wavelength is way off.
    - Does not even match [Kr III] 6826.7 very well, but it could be that, given the uncertainties
  - call_rest(6871.1948) {{{results(=6867.303=)}}}
    - This is in a region affected by telluric O_{2} absorption, so probably spurious
  - call_rest(6948.6948) {{{results(=6944.759=)}}}
    - This is outside the telluric range, but is probably a sky emission line
  - call_rest(7174.9448) {{{results(=7170.881=)}}}
    - Looks real, could it really be [Fe II]?
    - NO, this is an [Ar IV] 7170.5 line, which we were expecting
    - Prominence: 3.1
  - call_rest(7241.1948) {{{results(=7237.094=)}}}
    - This is the other [Ar IV] 7237.4 line
    - Prominence: 4.34
  - call_rest(7267.4448) {{{results(=7263.329=)}}}
    - This is the third [Ar IV] 7262.7 line
    - Prominence: 3.21
  - call_rest(7334.9448) {{{results(=7330.791=)}}}
    - Prominence: 41.2
    - This is mainly the [O II] 7330.73 line
    - Which is why we do not see the [Ar IV] 7331.4 line, although it must be contributing at the 10% level
  - call_rest(7246.1948) {{{results(=7242.091=)}}}
    - Prominence: 1.94
    - I am not sure what this is, maybe sky
  - call_rest(7277.4448) {{{results(=7273.323=)}}}
    - Prominence: 5.86
    - Also probably sky
  - call_rest(7284.9448) {{{results(=7280.819=)}}}
    - Prominence: 30.9
    - Certainly He I 7281.35
  - call_rest(7534.9448) {{{results(=7530.677=)}}}
    - Prominence: 6.66
    - Certainly [Cl IV] 7530.80

*** DONE Step 2: extract line maps
CLOSED: [2022-10-25 Tue 08:20]
- We can extract the 3 pixels around the peak
- Maybe use the 3-wav method that I developed earlier
  - That can give correction to line flux for the missing wings
- At the same time, we can calculate the true mean wavelength for each


**** DONE [1/1] Comments and plans for the line maps
CLOSED: [2022-10-25 Tue 08:20]
- [2022-10-09 Sun] First attempt - works pretty well
- [X] Things to improve
  - [X] Get a better-curated list of lines by combining several of the glob and fil regions, although glob-e is working pretty wellf
    - I have added in some from YSO and some by hand
  - [X] Increase the maximum width allowed, since I think we are missing some lines that might be blends, for instance 7221
  - [X] Better scaling of the image brightness. Currently, we are using the prominence in the particular region, but we could try using the median and mad of the image itself
    - We used percentile instead
  - [X] Maybe try subtracting the hyper-local "continuum" by using the left_bases and right_bases values.
    - Although this might increase the noise
    - But it might improve the weak lines near Ha, which are currently affected by the Raman wings, which makes us see the neutral filaments in negative
    - And the same thing happens around the Paschen jump
    - Yes, this worked
  - [X] Better color scheme. Choose a key color for each plot, based on the wavelength of the line, and then make a seaborn color palette based on that
  - [X] Use a more aggressive star mask, to remove more pixels that might have starlight contamination. And also use a NaN color in keeping with the color scale, so that the masked pixels do not stand out so much
    - /This is postponed for now/ [2022-10-25 Tue]

***** Multiple versions of the GLOB-E region
I am investigating different options for the line extraction to see which is best:
- Best value for wavelength window padding
  - Larger values capture more of the line flux, but can also bring in neighboring lines
  - For instance UIL 9019 is next to H I 9015, which leaks in when we use padding of 1.5 angstrom, but not when we use 0.5
- Whether or not to subtract hyper-local continuum
  - The utility of this varies a lot between lines
  - This is estimated from the "bases" returned by the find_peaks() function
  - At the blue and infrared ends, most lines are much better without it
  - But around the Ha wings, and for a few other lines in the 7000 and 8000 range, it really helps
    - For instance, the UILs at 6629, 6637, 6646 are quite invisible without it
- Which median filtered cube to use
  - So far I have been using the 101-pixel median
  - But the 11-pixel median might work better and avoid the need to use the hyper-local continuum
- Now I have added the option to use an extra suffix in the saved file, this will be easier to explore

**** Earlier ideas about filtering out false positives
- This is probably best done by visual inspection of the maps
- That should be able to identify the ones that are just
  - sky lines, or
  - noise
- Although, we could maybe have an automated method that looks at correlation with specific templates

CLOSED: [2022-10-25 Tue 07:55]
- I have made this in Google Sheets and am collaborating with Mabel to fill it in
- [2022-10-13 Thu] Started work on it
- [2022-10-16 Sun] First contributions from Mabel
- [2022-10-18 Tue] Nearly finished
  - I have left the interval 8000 to 9000 for Mabel to do
  - Apart from that, the entire range from 6000 has been done completely in the sense that each peak detected in GLOB-E and BS has been fully investigated and classified
  - At shorter wavelengths there are still some holes, but I think that they are all uninteresting
  - And I have not done a study of the YSO-only lines yet, but I would rather leave those for now since they will just get in the way


**** Read in data from the spreadsheet and write to individual YAML files
- I export it in excel format to [[file:../data/spec1d/All-Lines-MUSE-NGC-346.xlsx]]
- Examples of reading it are in [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-new/test-read-excel-file.py]]
  - Data can be read by pandas
  - Comments and notes require use of the openpyxl library directly
- Plan here is to read in excel file and to write out a bunch of little yaml files, one per emission line

*** DONE Step 4: Maps of different lines
CLOSED: [2022-10-25 Tue 08:21]
- Classification could be a natural by-product of the correlations
- [ ] But we could also make diagnostic plots, based on ratios of intensities in different regions
  - For instance, for the ionized lines and i-front lines:
    - Ratio between BS and MIP regions to distinguish IV from III
    - Ratio between MIP and NEUT/FIL regions to distinguish III from II and possibly I
  - For the neutral lines
    - Ratio between NEUT and FIL/GLOB to distinguish shallow from deep

*** DONE Step 5: Partition the map into different zones by predominant line type
CLOSED: [2022-10-25 Tue 19:22]
- Have different zones, according to which Type dominates:
  - 0 :: Deep Neutral
  - I :: Neutral
  - II :: Low Neb
  - III :: Med Neb
  - IV :: High Neb
  - S :: stars
  - MYSO :: MYSO-C
- Proceed via following algorithm:
  1. Choose a representative map for each zone, either a single line or the sum over several lines
     - Optionally, smooth the map if it is noisy
  2. For each of the maps, rescale a suitable brightness range to the interval [0, 1]
     - The brightness range might be min-max, or maybe 5-95 percentile, or whatever works best
     - This yields a normalized brightness map for each zone
  3. Each pixel gets tagged with the zone with the largest normalized brightness for that pixel
  4. Finally, we can mask out the stars according to some criterion

**** Complicated version that was not necessary
3. Loop over a sequence of normalized brightness thresholds, in ascending order: e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 0.9
4. For each threshold, tag pixels for each zone whose normalized brightness exceeds the threshold
   - Do this in descending order of number of pixels that would be tagged

*** DONE Step 6: Create per-zone spectra
CLOSED: [2022-10-29 Sat 23:07]
- This can be like the previous versions of 1D spectra
  - [[id:E860E6DE-06FD-4DC2-AA8E-9869D5112ADB][Inspect the 1d spectra results]]
  - [[id:BB8006B6-5B0F-487E-B35D-606D26B5C24F][Plot identified lines on top of the spectrum]]
- But adding in the info from all the YAML files
  - For example, [[id:41A1CAB9-5D31-437B-9D67-B34EB234BB5B][Do map of a single line]]
- And maybe also drawing inspiration from the stacking that I did in the notebook work
  - Although I am not sure if this can easily be combined with the ~symlog~ scale
- I have now had an idea for a two-pass median filter, with a scything (or shaving) step in between: filter-shave-filter
- Original try did not work right, so split it up into parts that can be individually tested
  - Make masks for each zone
  - Make a separate cube for each zone, with NaNs replacing all voxels outside the zone
    - This seems very wasteful of space, but it is the most flexible way
  - Finally, do the mean or sum to get the 1D spectrum


**** DONE Script to write mask files for each zone
CLOSED: [2022-10-27 Thu 18:25]
- Update [2022-10-28 Fri]: add an additional criterion that the normalized brightness in the zone's key line should exceed a certain threshold
- And also maybe trim off pixels around the edges that are particularly noisy
- Second update [2022-10-28 Fri 17:53]: remove the extra image mask, since we are now including stars as first-class mask citizens
- Third update [2022-10-29 Sat]: ~bright_threshold~ is now set per zone, which requires reading in the YAML file

*** TODO Step 7: Sum each line for each map zone
- We could use various different approaches for doing this
  1. Sum the 3 pixels, with or without the correction for the missing wing flux
  2. Or we could use the strength and width from find_peaks
  3. We can use the variations in the pixels just outside the 3 in order to estimate the uncertainty in the baseline
- Important thing is to get started on something, we can always refine it later!
- [2022-11-01 Tue] Spot checks on some lines from the 7



**** DONE Make a mask of all the line pixels and their neighbors, so we can avoid them when finding the BG level

- Original version [2022-10-30 Sun 21:18]
  - This does just one line, but it is very slow when run repeatedly for each line
- Revised version  [2022-10-30 Sun 21:40]
  - Now do all the lines at once. Works much faster
- Second revised version [2022-11-01 Tue]
  - Mask out the lines so that blends work better
- Third revised version [2022-11-05 Sat]
  - Do Gaussian fits
- Methods:
  - Only method so far is seven-pixel window. Outermost 4 pixels are used to estimate the hyper-local base level, and its uncertainty. Innermost 3 pixels are summed to give the line flux
- [3/4] Future improvements:
  - [X] Eliminate neighboring line pixels from the BG estimation
    - This should be easy to do by setting a mask
    - We currently have 4 pixels that are used in the BG estimation, so even if both pixels on one side are masked out, we still have enough
  - [ ] Use the 3-wav method to estimate the central wavelength and correct the flux for the missing wings
  - [X] Maybe some kind of Gaussian fit. Here is a possible plan:
    - CANCELLED, see next item
    - Take a big enough window around the central pixel to include all possible blends: 15 pixels would probably be enough
    - Run ~find_peaks()~ to get an idea of how many lines there are. Use a minimum  strength of say 0.3 times the peak from the 3-pixel method
    - Use those as Gaussian components in a fit (plus constant)
    - This is starting to sound way to complicated, and it would still not be able to capture underlying absorption features easily.
  - [X] A simpler Gaussian plan
    - Use the same 7-point window, and unmask the central line
    - Still have any other nearby lines masked out
    - Fit a single Gaussian plus continuum

**** DONE Attempt to fix up lines that have negative fluxes
CLOSED: [2022-11-06 Sun 19:13]
- [2022-11-01 Tue] Spot checks on some lines from the 7 pixel method to see if anything can be done about negative net fluxes
- I already fixed one line (previously 1935, now 1936) by nudging its index up one, which seems more in line with its appearance in the Zone 0 spectrum
- Now I am looking at all the lines that have negative fluxes in Zone 0
  - I have loaded the table line-fluxes.csv in DataSpell and can sort on different columns


***** Deep Neutral lines with negative flux in Zone 0
Initially, there are 10 of these, out of about 120. So even if none can be fixed, it still will not affect my claim to have more than 100 lines. Look at them in order of negative flux:
  
1. 3711 at 9233 \AA
   - This is in the wing of H I 9229, so probably nothing can be done without a lot of effort
   - Verdict: Leave it
   - SECOND UPDATE [2022-11-06 Sun 19:04]: This remains problematic, even with the gaussian fits
2. 3539 at 9019 \AA
   - A similar story: in the wings of H I 9015
   - This could probably be fixed by using baseline on one side only, but leave it for now
   - UPDATE [2022-11-01 Tue 17:01]: This now has positive flux after using the line mask approach
3. 3412 at 8860 \AA
   - Once again, the same story: in the blue wing of H I 8863
   - This would be the hardest of the 3 to extract, so definitely leave it
   - UPDATE [2022-11-01 Tue 17:01]: Also now fixed
4. 3397 at 8841 \AA
   - This has a stronger sky line close by
   - But it should not be too hard to measure. I have had an idea, we will see if it works
   - UPDATE [2022-11-01 Tue]: Still negative after fix. Oh well
   - SECOND UPDATE [2022-11-06 Sun 19:04]: Now gets a positive amplitude for the Gaussian fit, hurray
5. 2614 at 7823 \AA
   - Now positive, so yay
6. 2082 at 7499 \AA
   - Also, now positive
7. That is enough, cannot be bothered with any more. I have solved at least 5 out of the 6 worst. 
8. 
9. 

**** Do something with all the lines at once
- [2022-10-30 Sun] This line of thinking shelved for now. Maybe come back to it later when I do the plots of the ratios. For the moment, I will work on doing a single line at a time.
- [2022-10-30 Sun 21:51] Actually, I did go back to treating all the lines at once, but I still worked with the individual YAML files. I will leave this here as an example of converting those little files to a big pandas dataframe

*** Step 8: Inter-zone ratios
- Do diagnostic plots for the different lines
- One possibility would be to take the ratio of each zone to the sum of the zones
  - This would keep the dimensionality to a minimum, since we have only 5 ratios
  - Or maybe 6 if we want to separate out the YSO
- Alternatively, we can normalize the strengths to H beta and plot then plot them directly


**** DONE Line strengths normalized to H beta

**** Comments on the ratios
- All ratios are higher/lower: I/0, II/0, II/I, III/II, IV/III, MYSO/0
- The UIL consistently have low ratios in every combination (on average)
- They do not always agree with the C I line
  - In I/0 vs II/0, they loo like a progression towards [C I]
  - But [C I] has II/I around 8, whereas most UIL have less than 1
    - *no,  this is not right* It is a non-detection in zone I, so pointless to calculate II/I

*** Step 9: Final figures showing highlights from the spectra
- We can show only those spectral ranges that have Deep Neutral lines
- Show some of the different regions
  - Point out cases where we have blends
- Gray out the regions affected by sky and telluric absorption
  - Get the theoretical sky models
- Add annotations for all the different types of lines
- Include spectra from some of the partitions of the previous step
  - Also maybe add Orion and 30 Dor, but probably best not to
**** Choosing good microcosm ranges
***** 7350-7600
- This is an excellent range, which shows a great variety of weak lines
  - Deep neutral lines 7463, 7488, 7528
  - Several OH sky lines
  - Some very weak [Ni II] lines, plus an apparently neutral UIL
  - N I lines 7442, 7469
  - He I 7500
  - [Fe II] 7513, albeit only from compact sources
  - High ionization line [Cl IV] 7531
  - A sky OH line 7571.7 that may be blended with a deep neutral line
  - Very weak line at 7345 that could be Deep Neutral or Low Nebular
- It is marked purple in the spreadsheet
- It is bounded to the blue by the strong [O II] lines 7320-7331
- And bounded to the red by a telluric absorption band
***** 7800-8300
- Another good range

***** 6200-6800
- Shows all the lines around H alpha

** General points about the globules and filaments
- The background globules show bright heads and less bright flanks
  - This is evidence for the local anisotropy of the radiation field
  - And that the tail axis is aligned with the radiation
  - Suggesting that the globules have been sculpted to some extent (unless it is simply chance)
- The foreground ridge, on the other hand, does not look like this
  - It seems more to be illuminated from the side
** Lines of interest
+ Still to do:
  + [O I] 6300, 6363
  + [S III] 6312, 9069
  + O I 8446
  + [Cl IV] 8045
  + [C I] 8727
  + [Fe III]
** A possible high-ionization bow shock around Walborn 3

*** Lines to use for the bow shock
+ [X] He II 4685.71
  + 3-4 transition, so equivalent to Paschen \alpha
+ Lots of [Ar IV] lines!
  + [X] [Ar IV] 4740
  + [-] [Ar IV] 4711
    + Can give density diagnostic *but* it is blended with He I 4713
    + We can try and de-blend it using other helium lines
    + And it looks like the the He I contribution is small
  + [X] [Ar IV] red lines
    + 7170.5 and 7262.7 are clearly detected
      + But not 7237.4 strangely
      + Possibly because of contamination with C II
    + We can calculate a temperature from this!
      + See [[id:8B4C1164-B47D-47BE-9012-7DD0B661E014][[Ar IV] density and T indicators]]
    + Theory of [Ar IV] lines
      + (Ne, Te) diagnostic diagrams given in 
+ [Cl IV] 7530.8 and 8046.3
  + Unfortunately, the ratio gives us nothing since they come from the same upper state (S/N is not good enough to give useful reddening)
  + The auroral line is 5322.99 but it is not detected
  + [X] 7530.8 done, but contaminated by C II 7530.57
    + This is seen in the map, which shows emission from the filaments and clumps
    + The C II emission seems to come from much closer to the ionization front than it does in Orion
    + This is probably an ionization effect - the C^+ column in the ionized gas is much smaller because the spectrum is harder
    + But may also be a contribution of the low metallicity
  + [X] 8046.3
    + Also contaminated
+ He I 4713 - see above
+ [X] Look for other He I lines
  + [X] He I 4921.93
  + He I 5015.68 - on wing of 5007 but not excessively blended
  + [X] He I 5047.74 - weak
  + [X] Use PyNeb to find lines (or combinations of lines) that should be a fixed ratio to 4713, so that we can subtract it.
+ [X] Look for other He II lines
  + *none are usable* Or maybe they are
  + 4859.319 (4-8 Br \delta) - completely swamped by H\beta
  + 5411.52 (4-7 Br \gamma), which coincides with [Fe III]. Although that should not be a problem because there is no [Fe III] from the bow shock region (see below)
    + But it shows no emission - just photospheric absorption
    + Update [2022-10-26 Wed] Yes it does show emission
  + 6560.1 (4-6 Br \beta)
    + Probably too blended with H\alpha

  + 8236.78 (5-9) is clearly detected [2022-10-26 Wed]
+ [X] [Ar III] 5193.69
  - very weak and diffuse
  - does not seem to show any peak at the bow shock
  - T indicator with red [Ar III] line
+ [X] [Ar III] 7135.78
+ [X] H\alpha and H\beta to get reddening

    + We have a reddening map [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/data/ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits][ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits]]
    + Average reddening of bow shock region is E(B-V) = 0.087
    + We have a SMC reddening curve that we calculate from pyneb using parameters from Gordon:2003l
    + I am ignoring the stellar absorption EW for now, but that needs to be dealt with if we ever look at more reddened regions. 
+ [X] [S III] lines for temperature
+ [X] [Cl III] lines for density
  + These are rubbish, unfortunately.  Signal-to-noise is too low to say anything at all
+ [ ] [S II] lines for density
  + This works much better - s/n is high and we are clearly away from the low-density limit
  + We can distinguish the denser gas close to ionization fronts on filaments from the lower-density diffuse component
    + The latter has densities of order
**** Additional high ionization lines [2022-10-22 Sat]
- This is a by-product of work on the deep neutral lines
***** O II 4649 and 4642
- 4649 looks like the other high ionization lines
  - It looks very different from [O III], which makes me think that it *must be fluorescence*
  - We should compare prediction of recombination contribution, given the O abundance determined from the forbidden lines
  - I suspect that it may mainly be fluorescence though
- 4642 looks a bit different, but that is mainly due to stars
  - Doing a cut, you can see an increase at the bow shock
***** Si III 5740
- This also looks similar to the [Ar IV] and [Cl IV] lines, but a bit more diffuse
- Not clear if it is recombination or fluorescence
  

**** Lines that that do NOT come from bow shock
+ [Fe III] 4987.20 - has broad range of emission, but concentrated in the E of the field
+ [Fe III] 4658.1 - weaker than 4987, but similar distribution
  + Except for the mYSO, where it is super-bright
+ Lots of other [Fe III] and [Fe II] lines that only show up in the mYSO
+ Si II 5041.03 - mYSO and SE clump (which may be another mYSO)
+ [N I] 5200 comes from filaments and clumps, but not from ionized gas
+

***** Comments on the velocity patterns
- The siii 9069 line looks great now
- It shows more variation than the oiii lines, but they are correlated
  - It seems like the oiii has an additional diffuse component that has less variation
  - *AHA* that is not it at all - it is just that the d\lambda is smaller for the green lines than for the red lines, given the same velocity shift.  And our velocity pixels are fixed width in \lambda
    - If we shrink the range on the oiii then 4959 looks very similar to 9069 but with added artefacts
    - And 5007 also looks similar but with even more artefacts
  - The oi lines show even more variation than siii (and this is not explained by the different wavelengths)
- Things seem consistent wit the majority of the variation being due to brightness variations coupled with a general expansion along the line of sight
  - For instance, there are places where an apparent dust absorption causes the velocity to get bluer, which seems to be because the redder emission from the background layer is blocked
  - But there are other regions where a reduction in brightness is associated with redder velocities, which seems to be due to a gap between foreground blueshifted emission filaments

***** The bias in the 3 channel method and how to overcome it

****** Theory of 3-wav method
- We can use erf function to describe gaussian contribution to the three channels
- If we assume that channel intensities are A, B, C where B is peak and C > A
  - Say that C > A (if necessary invert velocity scale) so that mean velocity is between B and C
  - Then we can use C/A and (A+C)/B to characterise width and offset
  - Use a velocity scale {-1, 0, +1} for centers of channels A, B, C
    - Channel edges are [-1.5, -0.5], [-0.5, +0.5], [+0.5, +1.5]
  - Gaussian profile g(x, x0, sig) with x0 in range [0, +1]
  - So we can find the flux in each channel as
    - A = Int(g, -1.5 - x0, -0.5 - x0)
    - B = Int(g, -0.5 - x0, +0.5 - x0)
    - C = Int(g, +0.5 - x0, +1.5 - x0)
  - The integrals can be expressed as error functions:
    - Int(g, p - x0, q - x0) = (1/2) (erf((q  - x0)/ sig sqrt(2)) - erf((p - x0) / sig sqrt(2)))
    - Or Int(g, p - x0, q - x0) = E(q) - E(p)
      - with E(x) = (1/2) erf((x - x0) / sig sqrt(2))
    - If the profiles are not Gaussian, we can just replace erf by the CDF of the profile shape
  - So we get our two diagnostic ratios as
    - C/A = [E(+1.5) - E(+0.5)] / [E(-0.5) - E(-1.5)]
    - (A+C)/B = [E(-0.5) - E(-1.5) + E(+1.5) - E(+0.5)] / [E(+0.5) - E(-0.5)]
  - Alternatively, we could define moment-like linear functions
    - M_k = Sum(x^k F) = (-1)^k A + (0)^k B + (+1)^k C
    - M_0 = A + B + C
      - E(+1.5) - E(-1.5)
      - Signature -00+ 
    - M_1 = C - A (and same for all odd moments)
      - E(+1.5) + E(-1.5) - E(+0.5) - E(-0.5)
      - Signature +--+
    - M_2 = A + C (and same for all even moments)
      - E(-0.5) + E(+1.5) - E(-1.5) - E(+0.5)
      - Signature -+-+
  - Then we have the normalized moments
    - m_1 = M_1 / M_0
      - [+E(-1.5)-E(-0.5)-E(+0.5)+E(+1.5)] / [E(+1.5) - E(-1.5)]
      - This is exactly the same as the mean wavelength over the 3 channels
    - m_2 = M_2 / M_0
      - [-E(-1.5)+E(-0.5)-E(+0.5)+E(+1.5)] / [E(+1.5) - E(-1.5)]
      - This is the broadness parameter
  - [ ] Third alternative: use A and C directly
    - A / (A + B + C) = (m_2 - m_1) / 2
    - C / (A + B + C) = (m_2 + m_1) / 2
    - These have the advantage that they can be called Left and Right, or even Blue Fraction and Red Fraction
    - They tend to 1/3 when sigma is large
    - And they are both positive definite
    - The only disadvantage is that they do not separate into the significant and insignificant variations
    - And that we lose the approximate proportionality between \mu and m_1


****** TODO Sensitivity to noise of 3-wav method
- How does it compare with summing over a broader wave window?
- This will be different for strong lines or weak lines (as compared with the continuum)
- And also will depend on whether the "noise" in the continuum is independent in each pixel or not

**** General thoughts on the ionization structure
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
+ The projected area around W 3 shows
  + small arc in He II
  + larger but still centrally-concentrated arc in [Ar IV]
  + no particular concentration in [O III], He I, [Ar III], H I, etc
+ This suggests that the ionizing illumination is dominated by W 3 for E > 40.735 eV
  + But it does not dominate the illumination for E = 35 \to 40.735 eV or any of the softer bands
+ From the ACS H\alpha image, there is small region that shows the bow shell cleanly
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210614-130218.png]]
  Between about 3 and 7 arcsec from W3.  Beyond this, the globules start to dominate the H alpha and other medium ionization lines
***** Ionization balance of Ar
+ We should have
  \[
  \frac{Ar^{3+}}{Ar^{2+}} =
  \frac{F \sigma}{\alpha n_e}
  \]
  + F is the ionizing flux for h\nu > 40.7 eV
  + \sigma is the Ar^{2+} photoionization cross section
  + \alpha is the Ar^{3+} recombination rate
+ Assume constant T and that F only varies by geometrical dilution: F ~ 1/R^2
  +

:END:
+ This is now done better in one of the notebook files
  + But might be worth revisiting now I have better idea of the zero levels
+ From just visual inspection of the spectra I get
  | 4711.37 |  85 |
  | 4740.17 |  60 |
  |  7170.5 |   3 |
  |  7237.4 | 3.5 |
  |  7262.7 | 2.5 |
+ According to ratios specified by Keenan:
  + R_1 = 4711.37 /  4740.17 = 1.417 -> 0.1513 on log scale
    + This is low-density limit
    + In principle there may be some contamination by He I
      + But even if the density is high as 200 or so, there is hardly any effect on the temperature diagnostics
  + R_2 = 7238 / (4711 + 4730) = 3.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.02414 -> -1.617
    + implies T a bit bigger than 20,000 K !!!
    + *this one is bad* it is contaminated by C II 7236.19 or something
      + The map shows that most of the emission comes from the filament not from the bow shock
      + The contamination is not with C II, but is a deep neutral line at 7238.6, which seems slightly to red of the Ar IV emission
      + We could actually probably still extract the Ar IV line in the golden triangle
  + R_3 = 7263 / (4711 + 4740) =  2.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.01724 -> -1.763
    + gives T = 17500 K, approx
  + R_4 = 7171 / (4711 + 4740) = 3 / (60 + 85) = 0.02069 -> -1.684
    + but theoretically R_4 / R_2 = 1.33
    + We find R_4/R_2 = 7171 / 7238 = 3 / 3.5 = 0.8571, which must be due to contamination of 7238
    + So assuming R_2 = R_4 / 1.33, then R_2 = 0.02069 / 1.33 = 0.01556 -> -1.808
      + gives 17500 K, same as R_3
  + *Conclusion* Both R_3 and R_4 imply 17,500 K, while R_2 is hopelessly contaminated
  + *Except* I have not included the reddening

*** Other diagnostic ratios
- [ ] [Ar III] 5192 is extremely weak, but we can maybe make a measurement of Te
- [Cl III] lines are too noisy to be useful


*** Extraction of Spitzer spectra
- [2022-09-21 Wed] This is being done by Jesús
- I have provided him with a DS9 regions file with the following regions that correspond to the same regions that I have used to calculate the optical line excesses below
  - BS :: Bow Shock
    - Note that I have moved this a bit to the left to make sure that we include the He II emission zone
  - MIP :: Medium Ionization Peak
  - GLOB :: Globule
  - Each region has its associated BG background region
- Also I have added a couple of extra regions
  - YSO :: This is mYSO-C from Rubio et al 2018
  - FIL :: A clean section of neutral filament in a region where nebula and stellar emission is weak
*** Look at fractional excess in different features
- Compare the following
  - medium ionization peak
  - globules
  - bow shock
- In a bunch of different lines
  - measure in DS9

+ Rivero-Gonzalez:2012w
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-223450.png]]
+ T_eff = 55000 K or 51000 K with an alternative solution
+ Wind parameters:
  + Mdot = 2.5e-6 Msun/yr
    + I no longer have faith in this value.
    + Supposedly it is from the Ha and He II 4686 lines, but these are not well produced by the Fastwind models.
      + The model predicts emission in the wings of the He II line, which is not seen at all
        [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-122838.png]]
      + Green is the observations.  Red, blue, black is different T_eff models. Red is supposedly the average of blue (cooler) and black (hotter), so it is odd that it does not lie between them.
      + Also the POWR models give He II 4686 emission for the high mass-loss case (SMC-OB-III grid)
    + Observed He II line from W3 from MUSE:
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130804.png]]
    + Same for W1 (O4 If+)
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130853.png]]
    + So W1 has clear wind signature in the He II line
      + A velocity of 2000 km/s is \Delta\lambda = 31 \AA at 4686
      + The wings go from 4667 to 4710 -> +/- 20 \AA -> +/- 1280 km/s
    + [X] But note that they both have broad bumps in the wings of the H\beta line
      + *I now think these are not real*
        + I looked at the original spectra, and I think it is more likely to be a broad absorption feature around 4750 that has thrown off the continuum fit
        + Orion stars show the same, see Simon-Diaz paper
        + Might be some broad DIB
      + These don't seem to be predicted by any of the atmosphere models
      + /Could they be Raman scattering?/
        + No I don't think so
      + 4809 to 4919 \AA in H\beta -> +/- 55 \AA -> +/- 3000 km/s
      + Seems a bit excessive to be a velocity
  + Vw = 2800 km/s
  + Ram pressure at 1 pc
    + \rho V^2 = Mdot V / 4 \pi R^2
    + => = 3.687e-10 dyne / cm^2
    + P_ram / k = 2.67e6
    + **Lower Mdot value** Mdot = 2.2e-7 from Q_2 fitting of POWR models
      + Also, use R = 1.2 pc
      + P_ram = 2.2e-7 1.989e33 2800 1.0e5 / 3.15576e7 4 pi 1.2**2 3.085677582e18**2 = 2.253e-11 dyne / cm^2
      + P_ram / k = 1.632e+05
  + [2022-07-24 Sun] New measurements of wind parameters from Rickard:2022z
    + These agree with the values I got from the POWR models
  + Compare with thermal pressure of H II gas
    + P_gas / k = n_H (1 + y + 1 + 1.5 y)  T
      + Assuming x++ = 0.5
      + Also, ne = (1 + 1.5 y) n_H
        + y = 0.0824
        + P / k = ne T (2 + 2.5 y) / (1 + 1.5 y) = 1.963 ne T
      + Assume T = 13500 K
      + n = 1.632e+05 / 1.963 13500 = 6.2 pcc
    + Best estimate now is about n = 14 pcc from He II measurements
    + **Conclusions** We want a mass loss rate of about 5e-7 for ram pressure balance to work
      + This is slightly higher than we got from the He II analysis, but much less than the 2e-6 from before
  + We could also have a ram pressure component, so multiply by 1 + M^2
    + We can't have M much larger than 1, otherwise the density would have to be too low
    + And this makes no sense anyway, since the density measurement is for the inner rim, which must be static
+ Momentum efficiency of the wind:
  + Assume log L = 5.98
    + Radiation pressure at shell: P_rad = L / c 4 pi R^2 = 7.063e-10 dyne / cm^2
    + But only a fraction of this is trapped by shell
      + We estimate \tau_{abs} = 0.01 from infrared luminosity
      + And this gets multiplied by Q_P / Q_{abs} ~= 1.2
      + So the absorbed radiation pressure is 8.476e-12
        + => P/k = 6.139e+04
        + => n = 2.32 pcc
  + This means that the radiation support is not completely negligible
    + It amounts to about 20% of the total pressure
**** Atmosphere models for W3
+ The POWR OB models only go up to 50,000 K
  + This is just about acceptable if we take the lower T solution from Rivero-Gonzalez
+ There are 3 sets of SMC O star models with different wind strengths
+ I am first looking at the intermediate set
+ Model parameters for 50-42 (Teff = 50 kK, log g = 4.2)

*** Photospheric absorption lines from W3
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ We might be able to get a radial velocity
  + (assuming it is not a binary)
+ There is an absorption line around 4740, which in most stars is to the red of the [Ar IV] emission line
  + But in W3 it is to the blue
  + So if it is the same line, this suggests a large negative radial velocity
  + But I need to check other lines.  It would be odd for nobody to have noticed this before
+ The He II 4686 line and H\beta 4881 look better
  + These show W3 is not special
  + And most stars are blue-shifted with respect to the gas
  + Although this is assuming that the lines are symmetrical, which may not be the case if they are affected by the stellar wind
+ [X] Or we could look at red lines - the wavelength resolution is better there
  + But the lines are weaker
  + For the hot stars, we have the narrow line N IV 6380, which could give a precise velocity
+ [ ] Castro:2018a use the He II 5411.5 line to measure the radial velocities
  + Yes, this looks the best line
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210620-144147.png]]
    This shows the profiles of several bright stars.  The thick yellow one is W 3.  It is considerably more blue-shifted than the others.
  + We should modify the moment calculations to work with the ~contdiv~ files and determine EW and mean velocity (and sigma, and skewness ...)
*** Relevant papers on bow shocks in SMC
+ Gvaramadze:2011b
  - Massive runaway stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud
  - Detects several bow shocks in 24 micron emission
  - One is just SW of NGC 346, but it came from somewhere else
  - Sizes are 3 to 30 arcsec
    + 1 to 10 pc
+ Sheets:2013v
  - DUSTY OB STARS IN THE SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD. I. OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY REVEALS PREDOMINANTLY MAIN-SEQUENCE OB STARS
+ Adams:2013a
  - DUSTY OB STARS IN THE SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD. II. EXTRAGALACTIC DISKS OR EXAMPLES OF THE PLEIADES PHENOMENON?
  - Has an "interacting hotspot model" that seems to be very similar to a dust wave
*** Possible runway of W3
- Look at the stellar radial velocity in more detail
  - Although the possibility of binarity means this cannot be relied upon
- What about transverse motions?
  - If W3 was ejected from the core of the cluster, then it has moved about 6 pc to the west, which is in the right direction to form the bow shock
  - Assuming an age of about 2 million years, then this gives a velocity of
    - 6 pc / 2e6 yr km
    - 6 3.085677582e18 / 2e6 3.15576e7 1.0e5 = 3 km/s
  - This is very slow and would not produce a supersonic bow shock
- The internal velocity dispersion within the nebula is larger than this
  - 6 km/s sigma(POS) from Javier paper
  - 9 km/s sigma(LOS) from
*** The SNR to the E of the nebula
- Names: SNR J0059.4−7210, B0057-72.2, DEM S103, IKT 18
- Matsuura:2022v have a possible detection of 24 micron emission from the SNR
  - This is much weaker than the emission from the bow shock
- Maggi:2019q have x rays from the SNR, which show a nice circular morphology.  They do not see any significant diffuse x rays from the H II region

+ Basically, all fully ionized lines are similar: V = +162 +/- 2
+ [O I] and [S II] are significantly redder: V = 172 more or less
+ The [Ar IV] is similar to others: +162
+ But He II is redder: +157 +/- 2
  + But the difference may not be significant
*** Velocity patterns in the nebula
- In low ionization lines, there is a clear N-S gradient
  - In the S, the foreground filaments are blueshifted: V = 150
  - In the N, the background globules are redshifted: V = 170
- In the ionized lines, the variation is much less: 160 to 165 approx in Ha
  - There is a flip in behavior between the N and S half of field
  - In both halves, the ionized velocity variation tracks the sii velocity
    - But in the S half, the ionized velocity is redshifted from sii
    - Whereas in N half it is blueshifted from sii
- So on the one hand, this looks like a sort of Hubble flow, as in a PN, with expansion speed increasing with radius
  - although it is not spherical since we see it varying on the plane of the sky
- But on the other hand, we could interpret it as that the neutral globules are accelerated by the rocket effect, and then the photoevaporation flows largely undo that for the ionized  gas by flowing inwards in the frame of the i front

+ I have downloaded a bunch of spectra
  + [[file:../big-data/spitzer/tgt-108-selected_Post_BCDs/]]
  + (Not in the git repo)

  + I tried installing Cubism, but it is not compatible with macos 11
**** Dust opacity spectra
+ We need these in order to plot spectrum of modified black-body: \(\kappa_\lambda B_\lambda\)
+ Since currently, we are just using a \beta law, which is fine in the far-infrared but not in mid-infrared
  + But is it really worth it?
+ We can follow the same approach as in [[id:D71FC23A-3AE0-4603-8305-D7F6B7244A71][Effects of rotational disruption of large grains]] in the dust-wave project

*** Analysis of bow shock density, etc

**** He II lines
+ I have already tried to do this analysis in notebook 01-02:
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.py]]
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.ipynb]]
+ But I was getting inconsistent results, so I am going to start again
+ I had used a few different approaches:
  1. (Comes second in the notebook). Use the total He II luminosity to derive the ionizing photon rate Q_2.  The only assumption here is that all the He II emission comes from recombination (in photoionization equilibrium).
     - We find a flux of 2.04e-15 erg/s/cm^2
     - This corresponds to a luminosity of 9.28e32 erg/s = 0.242 Lsun
     - PyNeb is used to get emissivity of 4686 and \alpha_B(He^++)
       - but I had assumed T = 18000 and 12000
       - Switched this now to 12500, 15500 as more representative of measured values
     - This gives Q_2 = \alpha_B(He^++) L(4686) / e(4686) (\Omega / 4\pi)
       - Q_2 = (2.8 +/- 0.1)e45
     - This can be compared with stellar atmosphere models
       - See [[id:262D3FA1-80BD-4225-BE22-7970BD1FF6FF][Rearrange and rescale the models]] in this file. 
  2. (First in notebook).  Use peak He II brightness to estimate the electron density
  3. (Not in notebook, but see [[id:CC0FB6FC-FE95-4F68-B4F4-6CD1096297A2][Consistency check on the ionization fraction and thickness of the He II zone]] in this file). Estimate the thickness of the He++ zone. 


**** Ionization state based upon multiple lines
From the analysis of the



**** Other diagnostics
- We have the [Cl IV] lines
  - 7530.8
    - This is well detected, peak is about 7 over BG of about 1
  - 8045.62 
    - Wavelength from NIST but Atomic Line List has 8046.3
    - Blended with low ionization, but recoverable
    - Peak is about 15 over BG of 1
    - Maybe 7531/8046 is density sensitive?
      - *no* it should be 0.286 always
      - I measure 7/13 = 0.538, which seems rather high
  - 5323.2 auroral line
    - Wavelength is from Young:2011b
    - ALL has 5322.99
    - Very weak, but maybe detected with peak of about 1
- We can use the [Fe III] density from 4986/4658
  - Mabel did this for the entire nebula, getting about unity => n = 100 +/- 20
  - The lines are very weak, but it looks to me like we have 4986/4658 = 2, implying a lower density
    - That is in the E of nebula, it is more like unity around the bow shock area
- We also have the [Fe III] 5270 line, which can possibly be used as  T indicator
- Strangely, the [Fe III] lines are stronger in the NE and S edge than in the NW region
**** New lines
- UNIDENTIFIED at 8660 approx
  - There are a few N I lines around here, but this seems different
  - Aha, it is one of the unidentified lines from the Tarantula cubes too
  - Look for more of these lines
    - 8151 is there - very strong in the filaments
      - [Fe I] 8151.3424 
    - Si I 8035 clearly detected in filaments, but not in YSO
      - But now I think 8039 is the wavelength, so probably not Si I
      - Note that 30 Dor has a line around here, but it is clearly ionized
    - *Have these filaments had a SNR pass through them?*
    - Line at 8047 from filaments that blends with [Cl IV] 8046
      - perhaps 8038 is from same multiplet, in which case it can be removed
      - In 30 Dor there is no sign of this line at all
    - More from the 7800-8200 range
      - 7802, 7838, 7848 anf 7863 both weak with sky contam, 7891, 7926 super weak, 7959, 7997 super weak, 8009, 8017 super weak, 8039, 8069 super weak, 8083, 8151 strong, 8193 weak
      - Fourth one could be [Fe I] 7959.0029 
        - 3d6.4s2-3d7.(4F).4s a5D-a3F  4 - 3
        - Same multiplet as 8151 (2-2) and 7709 (4-2)
        - But why is 7964 (3-2) missing?
    - Comparison with 30 Dor 
      - The 8083 line seems there, BUT at 8083.5 and it traces ionized gas
        - It is next to a much stronger sky line
      - Another line at 8034.5 (observed 8041.24) is also ionized and might correspond to the 8039 line, but the wavelength does not seem right
      - 8009 (observed 8016) has a sky line right on top (how come this was not an issue for NGC 346?)
      - 7999 is strong in PDR in 30 Dor but we only see it in YSO in NGC 346
    - 6750-7800
      - 7463.5, 7238.5,
        - Second one might be [V I] 7238.64
          - Overlaps with C II 7236.42
        - First one might be [Ni I] 7464.367 except wavelength is not close enough
      - 7221 extremely weak
      - very weak: 7195, 7179, 7144 (broad), 7111, 7106
        - Second one could be Fe I 7179.9948
          - 3d7.(4F).4s-3d6.(5D).4s.4p.(3Po)
          - a3F-z5Do
          - 4 - 4
          - A = 8.463e+02 /s, which is largest for its multiplet
      - 7092.5 (blend with red wing), 7057.5 very weak
      - 7044
        - not a deep neutral line, but a very weird distribution
      - 7039 very weak
        - looks like a neutral fluorescence line (except not seen from YSO)
      - 7011 very weak
      - 7002 very weak except for YSO
        - clearly is O I 7001.92
      - 6987 weak
      - 6945 neutral only, 6963 super weak
      - Nothing much can be seen in range 6860-6940 due to O_2 telluric band
      - 6817 super weak, 6847 very weak
      - 6795 highly ionized bow shock line
        - This is [K IV] 6795.1, which is the weaker doublet member to 6101.79
        - It is good that I found this again independently
      - 6776, 6698 very weak, 6656 very weak, 6646 very weak
        - [Ni II] 6667 only from YSO
      - 6636, 6628
        - These flank either side of the 6634 Raman O I absorption feature
      - 7791, 7782 (blended wing to blue), 7768
      - 7747 (in blue wing of [Ar III] 7751), 7741 very weak
      - 7707 very weak,  7724 super super weak
      - These are in range 7590-7700 that is affected by telluric O_2 absorption band, so I am not sure how real they are:
        - But they do show up cleanly in the GLOB sample, so there must be something there
        - 7663 (broad multiplet/band), 7637 weak, 7628 weak
          - these look slightly more diffuse than the other lines, maybe
      - 7577 super weak
      - 7567 has something in FIL and NEUT-C, but I do not know if it is real
        - *No, this is sky*
      - 7531 [Cl IV] in bow shock
      - 7527 weak, 7488.5 weak
        - also diffuse
      - 7468.5, 7442 very weak, 7254
        - Clearly these are
          - N I 7468.31, 7442.30
          - O I 7254.15
        - Distribution much smoother than the other lines
        - Bright from mYSO-C and from Raman clump
      - 7463 is a clear deep neutral lines, right in the midst of those fluorescent lines
      - 7707 weak
        - This is close to Fe I 7708.8389, which is same multiplet as 8151
        - /Is this the same line?/ It is off by nearly 2 angstrom
        - *It turns out I was using the wrong velocity*
          - Should be +160 for the BG filaments or 150 for the foreground ones
        - [2022-09-23 Fri] But there are at least two lines here. We  need to investigate further
        - [2022-10-03 Mon] And these lines are strong from neutral regions, that is if they are not sky
          - Turns out that longer wave one is sky, at 7718.69 observed
          - Shorter one is certainly a neutral line, but also seems contaminated by sky
      - 7724 very weak
    - 6000 to 6530
      - 6503 very weak
      - 6460 very weak
        - This is certainly not C II 6462, which is perhaps detected from the bow shock region, but is even weaker
      - 6451.5 weak, 6448 very weak
      - 6434 very weak
      - 6371.5 ionized
        - probably Si II 6371.36
      - 6347
        - likely to be Si II 6347.11
        - Note that this looks like Si II 5978.93 and 5957.56 in its spatial distribution
      - 6270.3 very weak
      - 6221.6 very weak
      - 6084.2 weakest ever
      - 6046 also very weak
        - clearly is O I 6046.23
      - 6038 extremely weak
      - 5979, 5958 weak
        - Clearly Si II 5978.93 and 5957.56
      - 5740 very weak
        - Probably Si III 5739.73
        - Only seen in *bow shock area*, to W of W 3
      - 5577 badly affected by sky
        - But we can just about detect the redshifted [O I] line from the nebula, especially in the globules just south of W 2
      - 5412 He II emission from inside edge of bow shock, but affected by stellar absorption
  - YSO only
    - 7999 (maybe [Fe II] 7999.47) maybe also from jet (?) in globule
    - 8107, 8111, 8115 (maybe seen in Orion)
    - 8126 maybe Ca I 8125.31
      - seen faintly in 3 globules in addition to YSO, including one of the foreground globules
    - 8188
      - observed in Orion but unidentified?
      - also seen in lower globule (different one from above)
    - 7468.5 similar to 8188, likely to be N I 7468.3
    - 7452 probably [Fe II] 7452.54
    - 7442 probably N I 7442.30
    - 7412 probably [Ni II] 7411.61
    - 7378 probably [Ni II] 7377.83
    - 7172 probably [Fe II] 7172.00
- Si II 5041
  - This is very weak
  - But with a strange clump in the bottom left corner
    - Just north of the star at 0:59:08.5822 -72:10:57.667
- At about 7262 angstrom
  - No, of course this is Ar IV 7263
- At about 7500
  - He I 7499.85
  - But it seems more bow shock-y than the other He I lines
- Cl IV 7531 looks pretty strong
- Cl IV 8046 is contaminated, but it could be removed, perhaps by N I
- [K IV] 6101.79 ( ^3P_2 - ^1D_2 )
  - Weaker than the [Ar IV] lines, but definitely detected from the bow shock
  - There is another line of same multiplet at 6795.1 that we should look for
    - ^3P_1 - ^1D_2
    - Strangely, we do not seem to have a continuum-subtracted cube that covers this wavelength. The Ha raman wing section stops at 6800
    - Now we have it, and the line is detected, but it is very weak
    - Weaker than 6101.79 by a factor of 4 *as expected*
  - This is isoelectronic to [Ar III]
    - Equivalent lines are 7135.8 and 7751.1
    - Of which the redder one is also 4 times weaker (unlike what I first thought)


**** TODO Find the K+++ / Ar+++ ratio
- This can come from the [K IV] lines
- We could also do the Cl+++ abundance form the [Cl IV] lines
  - Best to use 7531 even though it is weaker than 8046 because it is less blended with low ionization lines


**** What is origin of second peak in [Ar IV]?
- This is centered on 0:59:07.3344,-72:10:48.188 in the lower left of the field
- The only O star there is MPG 500, which is classified as O6V
  - That does not seem to be hot enough to generate much [Ar IV]
  - On the other hand, Orion has some [Ar IV] emission, so it could be that
  - Alternatively, it could be related to the SNR to the East
**** Density and/or dust opacity from the infrared emission
+ From section 2 of Paper III
  + \Sigma = \tau / \kappa
  + \rho = \Sigma / h = \tau / \kappa h = n m
+ We have
  + \tau = 0.01
  + \kappa = 600 \kappa_600 cm^2/g
  + h = H R = 1.2 H pc
  + m = 2e-24 g
+ This gives us
  + n = \tau / \kappa h m = 0.01 / 600 \kappa_600 H 1.2 3.085677582e18 2e-24
  + => n = 2.251 / \kappa_600 H
+ So with H = 1, and using the He II determination of 13 pcc for n
  + => \kappa_600 = 2.251 / 13 = 0.173
  + => \kappa = 104 cm^2 / g
  + This seems reasonable for a SMC metallicity
+ We can convert this to a \sigma per H
  + \sigma = 2.1e-20 cm^2 / H


** General thoughts
+ Properties of N66 from Lopez:2014a
  + Q(H) = 4e50 /s = 40 x Orion
  + n = 100 pcc = 0.03 x Orion
    + In both cases there are large variations, however
  + R = 64 pc = 30 x Orion
  + *therefore* (n R) and (Q n) are both similar to Orion, so ionization parameter is similar too
*** Comparison of size scales and luminosities between Orion and SMC
+ SMC distance: 61.7 kpc
  + Distance modulus: 5 log10(D/10 pc) = 18.95
  + The brightest star in the vicinity of source C is V = 15
    + => M_V = 15 - 18.95 = -3.95
    + This is only 0.5 mag brighter than th1C, so probably O6V
  + Sun has M_V = +4.81 => V = 23.76
  + 10 pc = 33.43 arcsec, 50 pc = 167.2 arcsec

*** Ionizing stars in N66

**** Contribution of the WR+WR binary HD 5980
+ Considerable variation over last 20 years
+ *Conclusions*
  + For the low state, we have Q_0 = 1e50 approx
  + And a very low Q_2 (so no ionizing to He II)
+ High state (1994):
  + log L = 6.6
  + T_* = 47 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 111e-5
  + Vinf = 750 km/s
  + R_10 = 28 Rsun
+ Low state (2014):
  + log L = 6.23
  + T_* = 48 kK
  + Mdot / sqrt(f) = 14e-5
  + Vinf = 2100 km/s
  + R_10 = 19 Rsun
+ Transformation for POWR models
  - All their models are for nominal log L = 5.3
  - They use a transformed radius: R_t = R_* (V_inf / 2500 km/s)^{2/3} (Mdot sqrt(D) / 1e-4)^{-2/3}
    - where D = 1/f is clumping factor
  - For a different luminosity, we must rescale R_* as L^{1/2}
  - And Mdot scales as L^{3/4}
  - So we have:
    - High state:
      - R_* = 28 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.6)) = 6.268 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((750/2500)/ (11.1))**(2/3) = 0.09 6.268 = 0.56412 Rsun => -0.248 on log10 scale
        - Unfortunately, that is off the bottom of the grid!
    - Low state:
      - Luminosity is 10**(6.23 - 5.3) = 8.5 times higher than fiducial
      - R_* = 19 sqrt(10**(5.3 - 6.23)) = 6.513 Rsun
      - R_t = R_* ((2100/2500)/ (1.4))**(2/3) = 0.7114 6.513 = 4.633 Rsun => 0.6659 on log 10 scale
+ So for the low state, the closest model is 06-14: T = 44.7 kK, log Rt = 0.7
  + This comes with R_* = 7.5 => rescaled: 7.5 sqrt(8.5) = 21.9 Rsun
    + (close enough to 19)
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.01, 47.69, 0.00, 45.77 - so very soft
    + Rescaled back to real luminosity: Q_0 = 49.01 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 49.94
  + Mdot = -4.23 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.23) = 2.93e-4
    + this is not entirely consistent with the original 1.4e-4
  + V = 1600 km/s
+ We should also look at the closest hotter model 07-13: T = 50000 K, log Rt = 0.8
  + R_* = 5.9 => rescaled: 5.9 sqrt(8.5) = 17 Rsun
    + So this model and the previous one nicely bracket 19 Rsun
  + Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 = 49.09, 48.47, 36.46, 47.42 - so not so soft, but still almost no He+ ionizing radiation
    + Rescaled ionizing luminosity: 49.09 + 6.23 - 5.3 = 50.02
  + Mdot = -4.53 => rescaled: (8.5)**(3/4) 10**(-4.53) = 1.47e-4
    + Very close to original

+ M_bol = V + BC - AV - DM
  + DM = 18.95
  + AV = 0.3 approx (assuming E(B-V) = 0.1)
  + I have added an extra 1 mag extinction by hand to SSN 168
+ L/Lsun = 10**(0.4 (M_sun - M_bol))
  + M_sun = 4.73
+ R = sqrt(L / 4 \pi \sigma T^4)
+ So in terms of bolometric flux, the nearby B star totally dominates
+ But we should work out the external luminosity incident on the globule
  + And not include SSN 168 since that is on the inside
  + Sum over stars of luminosity x area covering fraction: \sum_i L_i \Omega_i / 4\pi
  + \Omega_i / 4\pi = A_glob / 4\pi d^2 = \pi r_glob^2 / 4\pi d^2 = r_glob^2 / 4 d^2
  + Take r_glob = 1 arcsec
+ The result is a total of 1.3e4 Lsun, of which half comes from W 2
+ So this is less than the inner luminosity from SSN 168 (3e4), if that was all trapped
  + Also, the external luminosities are upper limits, assuming that everything is in the plane of the sky
+ I have done the same for the ionizing luminosity
  + I get a total external incident luminosity of Q_ext = 6.3e47 s^-1
  + As opposed to an internal luminosity from the B0V star of 4e47 s^-1
  + The external incident luminosity is split up as follows
    + 40% from W 2
    + 24% from W 1
    + 17% from SSN 22
    + 6% from W 3
    + 13% from the rest (each 3% or less)
+ [ ] Now, we need to compare this with the Ha luminosity of the globule and of the inner sources
***** Relative contributions to the global ionization balance
+ The list above has all the stars with Q_0 > 5e48 I think
  + Except for some more that a long way to S or N
+ Total luminosity is 4.3e50
  + Could be 5.3e50 if we add in both WR stars as equals
  + Lopez:2014a give 50.6 -> 4e50
    + This is based on a simple conversion of the H\alpha luminosity of log L(Ha) = 38.6
    + [ ] We should compare that with the flux measured in our MUSE field
      + 
  
+ Recombination time:
  + Dense gas:
    + n_e = 100 pcc
    + \alpha \approx 2e-13
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1600 years
  + He II gas
    + n_e = 11 pcc
    + \alpha = 1.5e-12
    + 1 / \alpha n = 1920 years
  + So almost the same!  The lower density is compensated by a higher recombination rate
  + So recomb timescale of a few thousand years is small compared with stellar evolution timescale, even for WR stars

***** Conversion of spectral type to ionizing luminosity
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ Galactic case is done by Martins:2005a
  + Application to Carina in Smith:2006a
  + But what about the SMC abundances?
****** Spectral type to effective temperature
+ Massey:2005z show the S. Type - T_eff relations for MW vs SMC
  file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210527-134032.png
  + They find that SMC stars a bit hotter (green line) for both supergiants and dwarfs
  + I have inserted these temperatures as a column in the above table
+ [ ] But what about bespoke stellar parameter determinations?
  + Massey:2000l have
    + Q = (U - B) - 0.72 (B - V)
    + This is supposedly a reddening-free index
    + Then 
      - For Q < -0.6 and either (B - V)_0 < 0.0 or (U - B)_0 < -0.6,
      - log Teff = 4.2622 + 0.64525 Q + 1.09174 Q^2, (V)
      - log Teff = 5.2618 + 3.42004 Q + 2.93489 Q^2, (III)
      - log Teff = -0.9894 - 22.767380 Q -  33.09637 Q^2 16.19307 Q^3 (I)
  + However, I can't be bothered to look up all the UBV photometry necessary to do this
****** Luminosities, radii
+ We need the gravity to get the q_1 ionizing flux from the stellar atmosphere
  + function of T_eff, g, Z
+ But then we need the R to convert to luminosity Q_1
+ But we also have L_bol = 4 \pi R^2 T_eff^4
  + And we can find L_bol from M_V and bolometric correction
  + BC is known as a function of T_eff
    + E.g., BC = -6.90 log Teff + 27.99
    + Massey:2005z, equation (2)
    + From this, we can calculate the radii from M_V
      + If we know A_V
+ This is done in the table
****** Masses, gravity
+ [ ] The gravity should have a calibration with luminosity class
****** Ionizing fluxes
+ If the fluxes q_0 are not a strong function of g, then we don't need to find the gravity
+ We can use the same q_0 as in Martins:2005a, but using our T_eff, rather than their Galactic calibration
+ Apparently, the direct effect of metallicity on q_0 is small, but q_1 should be higher at lower metallicities
  + Quote regarding this from Martins:2005a section 6:
    : From the modelling side, Kudritzki (2002) and Mokiem et al. (2004)
    : have investigated the effect of a change of the metal content on the
    : spectral energy distribution of O dwarfs using CMFGEN models. They
    : found that H ionising fluxes are essentially unchanged when Z is
    : varied between twice and one tenth the solar content. They argue that
    : the redistribution of the flux blocked by metals at short wavelengths
    : takes place within the Lyman continuum, which explains the observed
    : behaviour. However, they show that the SEDs are strongly modified
    : below ~450 \AA, spectra being softer at higher metallicity (see also
    : Sect. 5.3.1). Morisset et al. (2004) have computed various WM-BASIC
    : models at different metallicities and showed how Z affected the
    : strength of mid-IR nebular lines emitted in compact H I regions. The
    : softening of the SEDs when metallicity increases is crucial to
    : understand the behaviour of observed excitation sequences.
***** Helium-plus ionizing luminosities 
+ This is important for the bow shock ionization
+ We are also interested in the ionization of Ar III -> Ar IV
  + This requires 40.735 eV, compared with 35.121 eV for O III and 54.418 eV for He II
  + Ar IV can persist in the He II zone since Ar IV -> V requires 59.58 eV
****** Consistency check on the ionization fraction and thickness of the He II zone

+ Based on the notebook [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.md]]
+ There I find that Q_2 = 2.8e45 /s
  + Old value of Q_2 = 4.7e45 /s was not using the right temperature
+ And I also found that n_e = 9.5 +/- 0.5 /cm^3
  + But that has to be multiplied by sqrt((1.0824 + 0.0824 x) / 1.1648 x)
  + Where x is the He++ fraction
  + And where we can simplify to 1 / sqrt(x) to +/- 10%
  + So another way of putting this is that x = (10/n_e)^2
+ The distance of the inner edge from the star is 4 arcsec = 4 9.23e+17 cm = 1.2 pc
+ So the ionizing flux is F_2 = Q_2 / 4 \pi R^2 = 1.625e+07 phot/s/cm^2
+ This should be equal to n_e n_i \alpha_B h = y_He x n_e^2 \alpha_B h / (1 + 2 y_He)
  + Assuming y_He = 0.082 and \alpha_B = 1.2e-12 cm^3/s
  + h = 1.165 F / y_He x n_e^2 \alpha_B = 1.165 1.625e+07 / 0.082 10**2 1.2e-12 = 1.9e18 cm = 0.61 pc
    + 1 arcsec = 0.3 pc
    + So this is 2 arcsec - just right!
+ *Return to this* [2021-07-23 Fri]
  + We now have Q_2 = (2.8 +/- 0.1)e45
  + Found the mistake! I missed a factor of 4 in the distance
  + I am going to now edit the values above
  + Now it all works out fine.
****** Estimating He++ ionization fraction
+ Now that we have the F_2 flux determined we can estimate the He++ x from local ionization balance:
  + (1 - x) y n \sigma F_2 = x y n^2 (1 + 2 y)  \alpha
  + x / (1 - x) = \sigma F_2 / \alpha n
  + We have all these ingredients except for \sigma, which we can easily find since it is hydrogenic
  + Turns out to be about 1.6e-18 cm^2 at threshold
  + Therefore, we can find
    + \sigma F_2 / \alpha n = 1.6e-18 1.625e+07 / 1.2e-12 (10 / sqrt(x)) = 2.17 sqrt(x)
    + x^{1/2} / (1 - x) = 2.17 => x = 0.63
  + So n = 13 pcc
  + Is this consistent with the Cloudy models?
    + Yes, more or less - but it requires the density to fall with radius

+ The Q0' (H0) and Q2' (He+) columns are ionizing luminosities rescaled so that the model has a bolometric luminosity of log L = 5.98, as implied by the cooler Rivero-Gonzalez solution
  + [X] We should also rescale the Mdot values - /now done in the final column/
  + All these models now give Q_0 = 49.80 +/- 0.01
+ The observationally derived Q2 is 45.45
  + For T = 50,000 K this is consistent with the SMC-OB-I 50-42 model, with Mdot = 2.2e-7
  + This is the intermediate wind case - the stronger wind has 2x too high a Q_2 (45.74) and the weaker wind has 4x too small
  + The higher gravity model (50-44) would require a slightly stronger wind (intermediate between I and II) to get the right Q_2
  + The lower temperature model (49-42) would require the strong wind (SMC-OB-II), which has Mdot = 2.3e-6

***** Correction for radius
+ The POWR models are a bit sub-luminous compared with W3
  + SMC-OB-I 50-42 has log L = 5.76
  + W3 has log L = 5.98 (cooler) to 6.08 (hotter)
  + Take the cooler one to start with, for consistency with the POWR Teff
  + So to rescale all the luminosities, we would add 0.22 in log space
  + Each model has a different nominal luminosity, so I am going to have to add in
+ Scaling of Mdot when luminosity is adjusted
  + Q = Mdot D^{1/2} (Rstar Vinf)^{-3/2}
    + where D is the clumping factor (D = 1/f) at 10 R_*
      + clumping increases gradually from sonic point to 10 R_*
    + all models assume D = 10
  + Models are with log Q = -13.0, -12.0, -14.0 for SMC-OB-I, II, III, respectively
    + Although in some places it says -13.5, -12.5, -14.5
    + But that is using a different definition of Q that does not include the sqrt(D) factor 
  + Work through for SMC-OB-II 50-42
    + R_STAR = 10.137 R_SUN
    + V = 3020 km/s
    + log M_dot = -5.771
    + D = 10
    + => log Q = log10(sqrt(10) 10**-5.771 (10.137 3020)**(-3/2)) = -12.0
  + Therefore, we should have Mdot scaling as Q R^{3/2} or Q L^{3/4}
    + This is now implemented in the final column of the above table
***** Correction for wind velocity 
+ From the previous section, we also have Mdot scaling as Q Vinf^{3/2}
+ We have a measured Vinf for W 3: 2800 km/s
+ So we should do an additional rescaling of Mdot by (2800 / Vinf)^{3/2}, where Vinf is the value from the POWR model
+ This is now also implemented in the final column


***** TODO What is this "excitation parameter" that the early papers mention?
+ It has units of pc cm^-2, which is length

****** Conclusions for Walborn 3
- log L = 6.12
- T = 51.7 kK
- Mdot = -6.65, so 2.239e-07 Msun/yr, which is very low for a supergiant
- This is more consistent with the hotter solution, whereas I was using the cooler one
*** What to call the stars?
+ My current plan is just to use the Sabbi ID numbers, which are in order of V brightness
  + SIMBAD says:
    : dic: Table 2: <Cl* NGC 346 SSN NNNNNN> N=79960 among (Nos 1-132733). Table 3: <[SSN2007] Sc NN> (Nos 1-16).
  + So I can just abbreviate it as SSN 152, SSN 168, etc
+ Alternative lists:
  + MPG gets used a lot

*** Different components of mYSO C
+ There are two continuum sources, presumably stars
  + Separated by about 0.3 arcsec
  + Sabbi ID 152 and 168
    + MPG 454 corresponds to both of them
  + The NE source 
    + Sabbi ID 152
+ Other correspondences
  + SSTS3MC 14.7725-72.1766 from Simon:2007r
    + They estimate 3.4e4 Lsun and 15 Msun
    + Their source includes both stars
  + Contursi:2000f give spectrum (their Peak C in Fig 6)
    + They estimate G_0 = 8.7e5
    + [ ] *We can use this to get a distance from the star maybe*
  + Whelan:2013d source PS 9
    + Spectrum is different from other sources
    + Prominent Silicate emission
    + Strangely low PAH 7.7/11.3 ratio although normal 6.2/11.3 ratio
  + Sewio:2013f
    + Source Y535
  + Rubio:2018f have the most comprehensive study
    + They have near-IR imaging and spectra
    + And they compare with the literature measurements 
*** SED modelling of the YSOs
+ Robitaille:2006f is what everyone uses
+ Although Zhang:2018k claim their models are more physically consistent

+ van-Gelder:2020z do X-shooter spectroscopy of sources in the LMC
  + Their Fig 13 shows Br\gamma luminosity vs K-band magnitude for a whole bunch of sources from MW, SMC, and LMC: 
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210524-110837.png]]
  + The ones that are way above the trend line might be good candidates for looking for Raman scattering
  + The SMC sources are in this category: relatively bright in Br\gamma
    + For Source C, observed K_S = 12.05, meaning M_K = 12.05 - 18.95 = -6.9
    + This means it must be the rightmost orange square, so L(Br\gamma) = 30 L_\odot, which corresponds to Q(H) = 8.554e+48 /s (see conversion factor from below)
    + So that would be like an O7V star if 100% covering factor
    + [0/2] But some questions remain?
      + [ ] How is Br\gamma flux apportioned between different components (two compact sources plus surrounding globule)?
        + This could be addressed by using the H\alpha fluxes from HST and/or MUSE
      + [ ] How feasible is external, rather than internal illumination?
        + For the globule it must be external because of the ionization gradient (seen in [O III] compared with H\alpha for instance)
  + Conversion of Br\gamma to other measures:
    + Br\gamma is 7 \to 4 transition
    + Equivalent H\beta
      + Table 4.2 of Osterbrock book has j(Br\gamma) / j(H\beta) = 0.0281
        + For T = 1e4 K in low-density limit
      + So 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma means 35.6 L_\odot of H\beta
    + Equivalent H\alpha
      + j(H\alpha) / j(H\beta) = 2.87
      + => 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma = 102.1 L_\odot of H\alpha
      + That is worth remembering: *H\alpha / Br\gamma = 100* more or less
    + Equivalent Q(H)
      + L(H\beta) = e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) VEM
      + Q(H) = \alpha_B VEM
      + => Q(H) = [\alpha_B / e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta)] L(H\beta)
      + \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
      + e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) = 1.24e-25 erg cm^3/s
        + (This is 4\pi j(H\beta) / n_e n_p in the Osterbrock table)
      + => Q(H) = (2.6e-13 / 1.24e-25) 35.6 3.82e33 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + => Q(H) = 2.85e+47 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + Remember, this is assuming 100% area covering fraction of ionization-bounded matter (no escape) and no EUV absorbed by dust.
        + So it is a lower limit on Q(H)
    + So th1C would be way above the line, at M_K, L(Br\gamma) = -3.6, 30
      + *but* that is assuming all ionizing photons trapped nearby
      + In reality, Orion S has much lower flux than this would imply
      + [ ] /need to calculate H\alpha flux from Orion S/

  + Nebular over-subtraction
    + Puts the emission lines in absorption in the faint regions
  + Telluric over-division
    + Puts telluric absorption bands in emission in spectra of bright stars
+ Spatial profiles in wings, continuum, Ha, [S II], [O III]
  + When is it spatially resolved and when not?
+ Look at more lines
  + [S III] and [Ar III] to see if they look more like Ha (central peak) or like [O III] (hole in middle)
  + Extinction from Ha/Hb - does the core of the line have nebular extinction (very small) or stellar extinction (A_V = 2.5)?
+ Density/temperature diagnostics
  + We have an [S II] density, but in the presence of gradients/inhomogeneities that will be biased towards low densities
  + Can we get any [Fe III] densities?
    + Mabel used 4986 / 4658
+ Kinematics
  + Local maximum in sigma(Ha) - but is that the line core, or the effect of the Raman wings?
+ Analysis
  + Optical depth of Raman scattering
    + Does it require dust destruction?
  + General thoughts on the young cluster
    + many of the stars seem to be aligned in chains
    + there is a 3-pronged "bird foot" pattern coming out of the brightest compact sub-cluster
