*** Lines to use for the bow shock
+ [X] He II 4685.71
  + 3-4 transition, so equivalent to Paschen \alpha
+ Lots of [Ar IV] lines!
  + [X] [Ar IV] 4740
  + [-] [Ar IV] 4711
    + Can give density diagnostic *but* it is blended with He I 4713
    + We can try and de-blend it using other helium lines
    + And it looks like the the He I contribution is small
  + [X] [Ar IV] red lines
    + 7170.5 and 7262.7 are clearly detected
      + But not 7237.4 strangely
      + Possibly because of contamination with C II
    + We can calculate a temperature from this!
      + See [[id:8B4C1164-B47D-47BE-9012-7DD0B661E014][[Ar IV] density and T indicators]]
    + Theory of [Ar IV] lines
      + (Ne, Te) diagnostic diagrams given in 
+ [Cl IV] 7530.8 and 8046.3
  + Unfortunately, the ratio gives us nothing since they come from the same upper state (S/N is not good enough to give useful reddening)
  + The auroral line is 5322.99 but it is not detected
  + [X] 7530.8 done, but contaminated by C II 7530.57
    + This is seen in the map, which shows emission from the filaments and clumps
    + The C II emission seems to come from much closer to the ionization front than it does in Orion
    + This is probably an ionization effect - the C^+ column in the ionized gas is much smaller because the spectrum is harder
    + But may also be a contribution of the low metallicity
  + [ ] 8046.3
+ He I 4713 - see above
+ [-] Look for other He I lines
  + [X] He I 4921.93
  + He I 5015.68 - on wing of 5007 but not excessively blended
  + [X] He I 5047.74 - weak
  + [ ] Use PyNeb to find lines (or combinations of lines) that should be a fixed ratio to 4713, so that we can subtract it.
+ [X] Look for other He II lines
  + *none are usable*
  + 4859.319 (4-8 Br \delta) - completely swamped by H\beta
  + 5411.52 (4-7 Br \gamma), which coincides with [Fe III]. Although that should not be a problem because there is no [Fe III] from the bow shock region (see below)
    + But it shows no emission - just photospheric absorption 
  + 6560.1 (4-6 Br \beta)
    + Probably too blended with H\alpha
+ [X] [Ar III] 5193.69
  - very weak and diffuse
  - does not seem to show any peak at the bow shock
  - T indicator with red [Ar III] line
+ [X] [Ar III] 7135.78
+ [X] H\alpha and H\beta to get reddening
  + [X] Extract line maps
  + [X] Fine correction for zero point offset
  + [X] Calculate reddening
    + We have a reddening map [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/data/ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits][ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits]]
    + Average reddening of bow shock region is E(B-V) = 0.087
    + We have a SMC reddening curve that we calculate from pyneb using parameters from Gordon:2003l
    + I am ignoring the stellar absorption EW for now, but that needs to be dealt with if we ever look at more reddened regions. 
+ [X] [S III] lines for temperature
+ [ ] [Cl III] lines for density  
**** Lines that that do NOT come from bow shock
+ [Fe III] 4987.20 - has broad range of emission, but concentrated in the E of the field
+ [Fe III] 4658.1 - weaker than 4987, but similar distribution
  + Except for the mYSO, where it is super-bright
+ Lots of other [Fe III] and [Fe II] lines that only show up in the mYSO
+ Si II 5041.03 - mYSO and SE clump (which may be another mYSO)
+ [N I] 5200 comes from filaments and clumps, but not from ionized gas

  |  7170.5 |   3 |
  |  7237.4 | 3.5 |

+ According to ratios specified by Keenan:
  + R_1 = 4711.37 /  4740.17 = 1.417 -> 0.1513 on log scale
    + This is low-density limit
    + In principle there may be some contamination by He I
      + But even if the density is high as 200 or so, there is hardly any effect on the temperature diagnostics
  + R_2 = 7238 / (4711 + 4730) = 3.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.02414 -> -1.617
    + implies T a bit bigger than 20,000 K !!!
    + *this one is bad* it is contaminated by C II 7236.19 or something
      + The map shows that most of the emission comes from the filament not from the bow shock
  + R_3 = 7263 / (4711 + 4730) =  2.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.01724 -> -1.763
    + gives T = 17500 K, approx
  + R_4 = 7171 / (4711 + 4730) = 3 / (60 + 85) = 0.02069 -> -1.684
    + but theoretically R_4 / R_2 = 1.33
    + We find R_4/R_2 = 7171 / 7238 = 3 / 3.5 = 0.8571, which must be due to contamination of 7238
    + So assuming R_2 = R_4 / 1.33, then R_2 = 0.02069 / 1.33 = 0.01556 -> -1.808
      + gives 17500 K, same as R_3
  + *Conclusion* Both R_3 and R_4 imply 17,500 K, while R_2 is hopelessly contaminated

** General thoughts
+ Properties of N66 from Lopez:2014a
  + Q(H) = 4e50 /s = 40 x Orion
  + n = 100 pcc = 0.03 x Orion
    + In both cases there are large variations, however
  + R = 64 pc = 30 x Orion
  + *therefore* (n R) and (Q n) are both similar to Orion, so ionization parameter is similar too
*** Comparison of size scales and luminosities between Orion and SMC
+ SMC distance: 61.7 kpc
  + Distance modulus: 5 log10(D/10 pc) = 18.95

+ M_bol = V + BC - AV - DM
  + DM = 18.95
  + AV = 0.3 approx (assuming E(B-V) = 0.1)
  + I have added an extra 1 mag extinction by hand to SSN 168
+ L/Lsun = 10**(0.4 (M_sun - M_bol))
  + M_sun = 4.73
+ R = sqrt(L / 4 \pi \sigma T^4)
+ So in terms of bolometric flux, the nearby B star totally dominates
+ But we should work out the external luminosity incident on the globule
  + And not include SSN 168 since that is on the inside
  + Sum over stars of luminosity x area covering fraction: \sum_i L_i \Omega_i / 4\pi
  + \Omega_i / 4\pi = A_glob / 4\pi d^2 = \pi r_glob^2 / 4\pi d^2 = r_glob^2 / 4 d^2
  + Take r_glob = 1 arcsec
+ The result is a total of 1.3e4 Lsun, of which half comes from W 2
+ So this is less than the inner luminosity from SSN 168 (3e4), if that was all trapped
  + Also, the external luminosities are upper limits, assuming that everything is in the plane of the sky
+ I have done the same for the ionizing luminosity
  + I get a total external incident luminosity of Q_ext = 6.3e47 s^-1
  + As opposed to an internal luminosity from the B0V star of 4e47 s^-1
  + The external incident luminosity is split up as follows
    + 40% from W 2
    + 24% from W 1
    + 17% from SSN 22
    + 6% from W 3
    + 13% from the rest (each 3% or less)
+ [ ] Now, we need to compare this with the Ha luminosity of the globule and of the inner sources

  + However, I can't be bothered to look up all the UBV photometry necessary to do this
****** Luminosities, radii
+ We need the gravity to get the q_1 ionizing flux from the stellar atmosphere
  + function of T_eff, g, Z
+ But then we need the R to convert to luminosity Q_1
+ But we also have L_bol = 4 \pi R^2 T_eff^4
  + And we can find L_bol from M_V and bolometric correction
  + BC is known as a function of T_eff
    + E.g., BC = -6.90 log Teff + 27.99
    + Massey:2005z, equation (2)
    + From this, we can calculate the radii from M_V
      + If we know A_V
+ This is done in the table
****** Masses, gravity
+ [ ] The gravity should have a calibration with luminosity class
****** Ionizing fluxes
+ If the fluxes q_0 are not a strong function of g, then we don't need to find the gravity
+ We can use the same q_0 as in Martins:2005a, but using our T_eff, rather than their Galactic calibration
+ Apparently, the direct effect of metallicity on q_0 is small, but q_1 should be higher at lower metallicities
  + Quote regarding this from Martins:2005a section 6:
    : From the modelling side, Kudritzki (2002) and Mokiem et al. (2004)
    : have investigated the effect of a change of the metal content on the
    : spectral energy distribution of O dwarfs using CMFGEN models. They
    : found that H ionising fluxes are essentially unchanged when Z is
    : varied between twice and one tenth the solar content. They argue that
    : the redistribution of the flux blocked by metals at short wavelengths
    : takes place within the Lyman continuum, which explains the observed
    : behaviour. However, they show that the SEDs are strongly modified
    : below ~450 \AA, spectra being softer at higher metallicity (see also
    : Sect. 5.3.1). Morisset et al. (2004) have computed various WM-BASIC
    : models at different metallicities and showed how Z affected the
    : strength of mid-IR nebular lines emitted in compact H I regions. The
    : softening of the SEDs when metallicity increases is crucial to
    : understand the behaviour of observed excitation sequences.

+ van-Gelder:2020z do X-shooter spectroscopy of sources in the LMC
  + Their Fig 13 shows Br\gamma luminosity vs K-band magnitude for a whole bunch of sources from MW, SMC, and LMC: 
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210524-110837.png]]
  + The ones that are way above the trend line might be good candidates for looking for Raman scattering
  + The SMC sources are in this category: relatively bright in Br\gamma
    + For Source C, observed K_S = 12.05, meaning M_K = 12.05 - 18.95 = -6.9
    + This means it must be the rightmost orange square, so L(Br\gamma) = 30 L_\odot, which corresponds to Q(H) = 8.554e+48 /s (see conversion factor from below)
    + So that would be like an O7V star if 100% covering factor
    + [0/2] But some questions remain?
      + [ ] How is Br\gamma flux apportioned between different components (two compact sources plus surrounding globule)?
        + This could be addressed by using the H\alpha fluxes from HST and/or MUSE
      + [ ] How feasible is external, rather than internal illumination?
        + For the globule it must be external because of the ionization gradient (seen in [O III] compared with H\alpha for instance)
  + Conversion of Br\gamma to other measures:
    + Br\gamma is 7 \to 4 transition
    + Equivalent H\beta
      + Table 4.2 of Osterbrock book has j(Br\gamma) / j(H\beta) = 0.0281
        + For T = 1e4 K in low-density limit
      + So 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma means 35.6 L_\odot of H\beta
    + Equivalent H\alpha
      + j(H\alpha) / j(H\beta) = 2.87
      + => 1 L_\odot of Br\gamma = 102.1 L_\odot of H\alpha
      + That is worth remembering: *H\alpha / Br\gamma = 100* more or less
    + Equivalent Q(H)
      + L(H\beta) = e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) VEM
      + Q(H) = \alpha_B VEM
      + => Q(H) = [\alpha_B / e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta)] L(H\beta)
      + \alpha_B = 2.6e-13 cm^3/s
      + e(H\beta) \alpha(H\beta) = 1.24e-25 erg cm^3/s
        + (This is 4\pi j(H\beta) / n_e n_p in the Osterbrock table)
      + => Q(H) = (2.6e-13 / 1.24e-25) 35.6 3.82e33 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + => Q(H) = 2.85e+47 [L(Br\gamma) / L_\odot]
      + Remember, this is assuming 100% area covering fraction of ionization-bounded matter (no escape) and no EUV absorbed by dust.
        + So it is a lower limit on Q(H)
    + So th1C would be way above the line, at M_K, L(Br\gamma) = -3.6, 30
      + *but* that is assuming all ionizing photons trapped nearby
      + In reality, Orion S has much lower flux than this would imply

  + Extinction from Ha/Hb - does the core of the line have nebular extinction (very small) or stellar extinction (A_V = 2.5)?
+ Density/temperature diagnostics
  + We have an [S II] density, but in the presence of gradients/inhomogeneities that will be biased towards low densities
  + Can we get any [Fe III] densities?
    + Mabel used 4986 / 4658
+ Kinematics
  + Local maximum in sigma(Ha) - but is that the line core, or the effect of the Raman wings?
+ Analysis
  + Optical depth of Raman scattering
    + Does it require dust destruction?
  + General thoughts on the young cluster
    + many of the stars seem to be aligned in chains
    + there is a 3-pronged "bird foot" pattern coming out of the brightest compact sub-cluster
    + the chains are approximately aligned with the filaments seen in the gas
*** Going through the lines we need
+ I am currently doing these for the sharper cube

**** Stars of moderate interest
This is a list of moderately interesting stars that are showing up in my line analysis
***** SSN 258
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ This is the slightly fainter star below SSN 62 in the globule just N of our main source
+ It is not in SIMBAD but has V = 17.26 (M_V = -1.69) and V-I = 0.167
  + That puts it around B4 spectral type according to Fig 5 of Martayan:2010j
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-121509.png]]
+ It has strong [N I] 5200 line emission
  + Possible spatially extended, but not much
+ Also shows Si II 5056
***** SSN 552
+ This one is just outside the cluster box in the star figures
+ In a globule
+ It is quite faint and red
  + V = 18.217, V-I = 0.616
+ Shows the Si II 5056, 5041 line but not much else
***** SSN 73
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ [[http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-coo?Coord=0%3A59%3A01.8832+-72%3A11%3A02.100&CooFrame=FK5&CooEpoch=2000&CooEqui=2000&CooDefinedFrames=none&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcsec&submit=submit+query][Simbad link]] shows it as "emission line star", B1
  + Probably a Be star, although unclear whether pre-MS or post-MS
  + See Martayan-2010j
  + Also Paul:2017t
+ Has lots of lines that show up in the pass band around 6300 \AA
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-084339.png]]
+ The above spectrum shows the globule close to our main source (SSN 152+168) in orange and SSN 73 in yellow
+ In addition to the usual [O I], [S III], Si II, we have lines emission lines at 6247, 6317, 6383
  + Some of these are also seen weekly in our main compact source

**** [O I] 6300, 6363 (+ [S III], Si II)
+ This is done in [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/03-03-oi-lines-sharp-cube.md][03-03-oi-lines-sharp-cube.md]]
+ As well as the [O I] lines, we have [S III] 6312 and Si II 6347 and 6371
  + The Si II lines come from compact sources only
**** [Ar IV] 4711, 4740
+ The 4711 is blended with He I 4713, but we can see the effect of both
+ the 4740 line is great - it is very diffuse, but has an inner hole the same as [O III]
  + This could correspond to the inner wind bubble
**** He II 4686
+ Another great line - it shows a beautiful emission arc just inside the [Ar IV] emission
+ We can calculate the flux and then convert to a > 4 Ryd luminosity and see if this is consistent with expected stellar EUV
+ The arc shows no extinction by the globule filaments, and so must be foreground to them
+ *I need to do this for the summed cube too* to increase signal-noise
