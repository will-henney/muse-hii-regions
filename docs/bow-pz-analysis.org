* Calculate line ratios from the new "refined" emission maps and spectra
- This is going to be a partial re-run of all that I did in the notebooks such as
  - [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-orig/01-00-line-ratios.py]]
    Mainly [S II] ratios
  - [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-orig/01-01-more-line-ratios.py]]
  - [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-orig/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.py]]
- Question is, do I want to do it in notebooks, or here in this org file with some scripts
  - Notebooks might be easier, but it might be better to split it up into smaller parts
  - Although the easiest thing to do to start with is to just run them as is. 

    
** TODO Rerun of the PZ-01-*.ipynb as ZZ-01-*.ipynb

- [X] Copy the .py files to the new folder [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-bow/]] and rename them with ZZ prefix
- [X] Regenerate the notebook files with jupytext
  #+begin_src sh :dir ../notebooks/ngc346-bow/ :eval no
    jupytext --show-changes --sync *.py
  #+end_src
  Note that the ~-d~ option has changed to ~--show-changes~
  
*** Look at the [S II] line ratios
- Going through the initial part of the first notebook
  - I loaded the median-subtracted cube and followed the same steps, except that I did not subtract the continuum, since that has already been done
