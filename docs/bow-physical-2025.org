This can be a re-run of what I did for Ou 5 in [[id:016ABC59-2154-4188-A3FA-64A6515ED166][Graphical Zanstra method from Harman:1966a]]
in [[file:../../teresa-pn-ou5/docs/pn-ou5-physics.org]]
*** Observations that I will need
1. Flux of He II 4686 line (I have that)
2. Stellar continuum flux - we can measure it ourself or take literature values
3. Covering fraction of bow shock (I have already estimated that somewhere)
*** What I will get
- This should give an estimate of the stellar effective temperature
- It does depend on the black-body assumption
- But we can also do it from stellar atmosphere models
- 
*** Continuum flux
- It looks like there is consistency between the Bouret and Sabbi measurements
  - The SIMBAD values from Bonanos are consistently brighter, but they are probably contaminated by the nebula
- So we can take V = 13.45, B = 13.20
- In theory, we want something intermediate, so we can take 13.30
- The reddening is E(B - V) = 0.040
  - SMC has R_V = 2.74, so A_V = 0.1096 and E(B-V) = A_B - A_V, so A_B = 0.15
  - We take the average of 0.13
  - So de-reddened mag would then be 13.17
  - *however* for the nebula we assumed A(He II) = 0.34, which is a lot higher
    - This could be explained if that were to be characteristic of the background nebula, but the star and the bow shock are in the foreground and so suffer less extinction
    - This comes from an estimate of E(B-V) = 0.097 for the bowshock region of the nebula, which gave A(H beta) = 0.33, so assuming E(B-V) = 0.04 instead would give A(Hb) = 0.136
    - If we take the average and std of the star and nebula reddening estimates, we would have:
      - E(B-V) = 0.0685 +/- 0.0285 = 0.0685 (1 +/- 0.4161)
      - A(Hb) = 0.233 (1 +/- 0.4161)
      - Reddening flux correction @ H beta = 10**(0.4 0.233 (1 +/- 0.4161)) = 1.24 +/- 0.11
  - *Final de-reddened magnitude at H beta: 13.1*
    - The reddening uncertainty does not matter so long as we use the same for the He II line
- We use the AB magnitude definition from [[id:089874E1-67F5-455B-BC7C-CC0891434EEA][Absolute flux calibration of the stellar magnitudes]]
  - log f_\nu (ergs s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1) = -0.4 AB_\nu - 19.44
  - At 4686: log \nu = 14.8060184187
  - log \nu f_\nu = = -0.4 AB_g - 4.6340
- So our de-reddened log \nu f_\nu = -0.4 13.1 - 4.6340 = -9.874
  - This is considerably brighter than the CSPN of Ou 5
  - We can calculate the absolute magnitude as M_\lambda = 13.1 - 18.91 = -5.81

*** He II flux
+ We have this from the MUSE observations
+ From the 01-02 notebook we have 2.79e-15 erg/s/cm^2
  + Although that is using the Balmer decrement extinction of A = 0.34, which is higher than the 0.23 we derive above as a compromise between the star and nebula value
  + Correcting for that gives 2.79e-15 10**(0.4 (0.23 - 0.34)) = 2.52e-15 erg/s/cm^2
+ This is much less than in Ou 5, where it was 9e-13 erg/s/cm^2
+ Note that this is for only the bright portion of the shell, and it may be affected by underlying stellar absorption in the photosphere of W 3



*** Covering fraction
- Earlier calculations are in [[id:4055F9D2-DB08-454E-AB02-93DB439029BE][Covering fraction of the He II shell]]
- This is the parameter \xi = \Omega / 4\pi in the Harman:1966a theory
- Assume a spherical cap with opening half-angle \theta
  - \Omega = 2\pi \int d\mu = 2\pi (1 - cos \theta)
  - \xi = 0.5 (1 - cos \theta)
  - I am going to say \theta = 59 +/- 6 deg (see [[id:2BEC10AA-976A-42CF-B18C-59DE9C07938A][Workings for cap geometry]])
  - \xi = 0.24 +/- 0.04

+ Peak in He II is displaced 4 arcsec = 20 pix from star
+ Vertical half-height of cap is about y = 25 +/- 5 pixels
+ And that is shifted in a bit by about 5 +/- 2 pixels
+ So we have (x, y) = 15 +/- 2, 25 +/- 5
+ \theta = arctan((25 +/- 5)/(15 +/- 2)) = 59 +/- 6

*** Derived Zanstra temperature
| t | log Ratio      | log \Lambda (star) |
|---+----------------+---------------|
| 4 | -0.60 +/- 0.09 | 1.99 +/- 0.05 |
| 5 | 0.75 +/- 0.09  | 2.24 +/- 0.05 |
|   |                |               |
- We want the T where the two \Lambda are equal
- This is clearly between t=4 and 5, but we need to do a finer grid to get more precision
  - Linear interpolation on log ratio would give 4 + (0.6 / (0.6 + 0.75)) = 4.44 kK
- But looks like about 45,000 K, which is significantly less than the 50,000 K derived from atmosphere models
- 

*** Derived luminosity

- This is L / Lsun = (D/kpc)**2 \Lambda = 61.7**2 \Lambda = 3806.89 \Lambda
- From the linear interpolation, this should be log \Lambda = 1.99 + 0.44 0.25 = 2.1
- L = 3806.89 10**2.1 = 4.8e5 Lsun
