This can be a re-run of what I did for Ou 5 in [[id:016ABC59-2154-4188-A3FA-64A6515ED166][Graphical Zanstra method from Harman:1966a]]
in [[file:../../teresa-pn-ou5/docs/pn-ou5-physics.org]]
*** Observations that I will need
1. Flux of He II 4686 line (I have that)
2. Stellar continuum flux - we can measure it ourself or take literature values
3. Covering fraction of bow shock (I have already estimated that somewhere)
*** What I will get
- This should give an estimate of the stellar effective temperature
- It does depend on the black-body assumption
- But we can also do it from stellar atmosphere models
