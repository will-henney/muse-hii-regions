** TODO [3/7] Return to bow project 2023 Summer and 2025 Winter
- [2025-10-17 Fri] Third return 2025 October
  - Need to wrap up and de-scope if necessary the paper finished!
- [2024-01-18 Thu] Second return 2024 January
  - Inspired by the JWST images
    - which show lots of additional bow shocks 
  - Need to get this paper finished quickly
- What remains to be done?
  - [X] Rerun all the notebooks since I seem to have lost all the results cells
    - Looks like best way is with nbconvert
    - See [[id:EB6FFF61-D26C-484F-8CDF-C680BAB9366F][Rerunning the notebooks [2023-06-01 Thu]â€‹]]
  - [-] Maybe repeat for the Peter Zeidler cube
    - This is mostly done now, see [[file:bow-pz-analysis.org]]
    - This is based on the 3-wave line extraction done in [[file:bow-pz-maps.org]]
    - What I am unsure of is whether I need to do the flux correction or not
  - 
  - [ ] Think what are the essentials for the paper

*** Technical stuff
- [2025-10-16 Thu 19:37] I have switched over to using uv
  - This was pretty easy
  - I am using python 3.14
- I had to pin some dependencies
  - mpdaf 3.6 seems very broken, so I have pinned to 3.5
  - And mpdaf 3.5 is incompatible with numpy 2.0, so I had to downgrade that
*** TODO Taking stock of the paper
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2025-10-17 Fri 11:09] \\

**** Physics of bow shock
- We can estimate the stellar wind parameters once we have the thermal pressure of the bow shock
*** DONE Issues in re-running some notebooks 2024
CLOSED: [2024-04-11 Thu 18:30]
- [2024-03-12 Tue] I wanted to check on what the limits of the [Cl III] densities were, so I was running the notebook 01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.ipynb
  - lots of little things were working strangely, mainly relate to different array sizes between different line maps
    - so I need to work out where this is coming from
    - it looks like the line maps are actually generated in the 03 series of notebooks, so I need to go back to those
- [2024-04-11 Thu] *hurray* I solved this problem I think
  - The issue was that on June 4 I made a mistake when running one of the new PZ series of notebooks and I overwrote the original versions of the hei-5875 maps. I didn't notice this until after I had committed the changes.
  - This is why I was getting an error about inconsistent array dimensions when trying to take line ratios
  - Anyhow, I managed to fix it by checking out those files from the git history, which I did using magit as follows
    - visit fits file in emacs and do ~C-c G~ to bring up the magit file actions
    - type ~, c~ to checkout a previous revision
    - paste in the id of the commit I wanted to use (previously copied from the history)
    - confirm the file I want to check out
    - had to repeat this for all 3 files, which was a bit of a pain
  - And that now works in the notebook, so all is now sorted
- [2024-04-24 Wed] Turns out that there were further files that had got overwritten. Instead of restoring them from git, I have been re-running the notebooks to get the data back. 
*** TODO Combining best aspects of all the data
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2024-04-24 Wed 22:00] \\
  Plan for how to improve all the line ratios
:END:
- So the Peter cube is the only one with a decent zero point, but it is very noisy in other respects
  - /In the following I will use *PZ* to refer to the Peter Zeidler cube and *ESO* to refer to the standard pipeline-reduced cube from the ESO archive/
- The original ESO cube is less noisy but many of the extracted lines have negative portions
- The lines extracted as part of the Mabel project seem better than the original ones from the notebooks, although I need to check exactly how they were generated
- If I plot the PZ images against the corresponding ESO ones, I can find a correction to the zero points and hopefully get the best of both worlds
**** Plan for combining PZ and ESO
1. Run the image extraction for all the lines on the PZ cube. Follow the steps in [[id:B915BA48-D7C9-4FFE-9ECF-511CBF1A4ED7][Step 4: Maps of different lines]] in [[file:ngc-346-drl-spectra.org]]
2. Reproject to a common WCS with the ESO-derived maps
   - Turns out that the pixels are the same, so we can jus transfer the PZ wcs, no need to reproject
   - We just need to shave the rightmost column from the PZ maps, since they are one pixel wider than the ESO ones
3. Plot the joint histogram of the two maps for each line, so we can correct the zero point
4. Then we can redo the analysis of the line ratios, such as He I/H I
   - For this, we could use the Zones to mask out all but Zones III and IV
*** DONE Better projection of the Cloudy models
CLOSED: [2024-04-11 Thu 10:10]
- In the original notebooks where I looked at the output from the Cloudy models, I had an integral to do the projection onto the plane of the sky
  - but there is something wrong with it because it gives spikes in the output
  - I need to go back and see if there is a better way to do this
  - possibly using the old rot-splat method
  - or even looking into how pyCloudy does it
- in order to get to this, we have a whole load of yak shaving to do
**** DONE All working now with a change of variables
CLOSED: [2024-04-11 Thu 10:09]
- We now do the integral explicitly in z, instead of in r, which is much better since it avoids any singularities
- Here is the [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-orig/20-00-ngc346-bowshock-cloudy.py::Alternatively, we can do the integral in z][relevant section of the notebook]] 
- And we do not need to do any interpolation either
**** DONE Update cloudytab to accept pathlib.Path objects as well a strings
CLOSED: [2024-03-13 Wed 10:39]
- While I am doing this, I would like to update the package to use rye
- And maybe even publish it to PyPI
- Note that previously I had been including the cloudytab package as a git subtree (legally distinct from submodule I think)
  - see [[id:FEA75A95-3429-4C02-B970-94D7BC5087F4][Another git subtree for cloudytab library]] in [[file:README-2021.org]]

***** DONE Convert project to rye
CLOSED: [2024-03-12 Tue 20:42]
- First I updated rye
  #+begin_src sh
    rye self update
  #+end_src
  Now we are on version rye 0.29.0
- Then I initialized project
  #+begin_src sh
    rye init
  #+end_src
  This made a src folder and a pyproject.toml file
- Then I did first sync
  #+begin_src sh
    rye sync
  #+end_src
  This made a virtual environment in ~.venv/ folder and did an editable install of the package
- Then I did the following
  1. Moved the main library source file to the src folder
  2. Wrote a test file with one test and put it in the test folder
  3. Did ~rye add pytest --dev~ to add pytest as a development dependency
     - This seem to automatically install the new dependency, which is new behavior I think. Previously I had had to to do ~rye sync~ to get that
  4. Ran the tests with ~rye test~
     - I did not expect this to work, since it is something else that I think is new
     - The test passed fine, but it did not do the coverage report. Presumably there is some extra config setting I need to do
  5. Added another test that imports the library. That passes too after I got the right message: "Hello from cloudytab"
  6. Install pyright type checker with ~rye add pyright --dev~ and configure and run it
     - I put a minimal config in the pyproject.toml file
     - Then I ran ~rye run pyright~, which found an error since I am specifying a minimum python version of 3.8, which means I have to use Union instead of the pipe operator. But adding ~from __future__ import annotations~ fixed that
     - I can make pyright pass using the "standard" mode but not the "strict" mode. This is entirely because of astropy not having type stubs, so I will not leave any sleep over it
***** DONE Publish to pyPI
CLOSED: [2024-03-12 Tue 21:55]
- This is so that I can easily use the package in another project, such  this one
- First, I try with the test server for which I already have an account
  - ~rye build~
  - ~rye publish --repository testpypi --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/~
  - Note that you have to remember to do the build step before the publish step, otherwise it will just upload the old version
  - Also it uploads all the versions each time, which is a bit wasteful. Maybe there is a way to avoid that
  - I had to generate an access token. I used it with an empty passphrase
- Now try it on the real pyPI
  - ~rye publish --skip-existing~
  - I now have my first package on pyPI - hurray!
  - The step that took the longest was creating the account, and the recovery codes, and the 2-factor authentication, etc
***** DONE Switch over to pyPI version of cloudytab for this repo
CLOSED: [2024-03-13 Wed 10:39]
- [2024-03-13 Wed 10:03] In the long term, I want to switch this repo to using its own venv but at the moment we will stick to the anaconda python 3.9 that I have been using since forever
- [X] pip install cloudytab in the conda environment
- [X] check that I can use this version in my notebooks
  - I removed the addition of ~../../lib~ to sys.path so it should be using the installed version
  - I managed to import the package and load a cloudy model
- [X] remove the git subtree of cloudytab from this repo
  - deleted the folder and removed the remote

:END:
- I have lost all the results cells in the notebooks, so I need to rerun them
  - Turns out that I had not actually lost the outputs in my working tree, they were just stripped out by the git filter
  - So there is no longer any need to re-run them all, but I will do it anyway, since it has revealed a problem with the relative paths now that I have moved them to a sub-folder
- Here is a [[https://mljar.com/blog/run-jupyter-notebook-command-line/][useful blog post]] with various methods
- Looks like ~nbconvert~ is best for our purposes here
  - Example command line
    #+begin_src sh :eval no :dir ../notebooks/ngc346-orig
      jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace 01-00-line-ratios.ipynb
    #+end_src
  - Also make an html version for ease of viewing
    #+begin_src sh :eval no :dir ../notebooks/ngc346-orig
      jupyter nbconvert --to html 01-00-line-ratios.ipynb 
    #+end_src
- Problems encountered
  1. I have to adjust some relative paths in the notebooks since I moved them into subdirectories
     - Best to do that in the pure python version and use jupytext to convert to ipynb
     - Now sorted for [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-orig/01-01-more-line-ratios.py][01-01-more-line-ratios.py]], which was much messier than it should have been because I decided to do things properly with ~Pathlib~ but had forgotten that MPDAF does not support that, so had to convert back to strings
  2. It looks like I am running some sort of hook that strips out all of the notebook outputs when it pushes
     - Why would I have done that?
     - This is now solved. It turns out I had a filter that was running ~nbstripout~ on all notebooks. I have now removed that filter. And I have learned that git filters and hooks are different things. And I should not have been blaming pre-commit, which is actually great.
  3. moments.py is now part of whispy, so we need

       from whispy import moments

*** Steps to update the notebooks
For example, for this notebook:
#+begin_src sh
STEM=02-01-Raman-Wings-IR-Source-C
#+end_src
1. Edit the ~$STEM.py~ file to fix any relative paths and optionally remove any Dataspell metadata that is lying around
2. Save the file, which for me automatically runs black on it. Delete buffer in Emacs to avoid confusion
3. Sync all versions of the notebook to the pure python version
   #+begin_src sh
     jupytext -d --sync $STEM.ipynb
   #+end_src
4. Re-execute the notebook
   #+begin_src sh
     time jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace $STEM.ipynb
   #+end_src
5. Sync all versions again (this time it will be from the ipynb version because it is the most recently updated)
   #+begin_src sh
     jupytext -d --sync $STEM.ipynb
   #+end_src
6. Now open the notebook in jupyter to check that it looks OK
7. Finally, convert to html for ease of quick viewing
   #+begin_src sh
     jupyter nbconvert --to html $STEM.ipynb
   #+end_src
*** TODO Do versions of notebooks but with Peter data swapped in
- [ ] Decide exactly what needs to be done for the bow paper
  - I think mainly the line ratios series of notebooks
    - ~01-00-line-ratios.ipynb~ will be a good one to start with
    - This first looks at the [S II] lines, which will be a good test of how well the Peter cube does for medium-strength lines
    - Yes, that worked out excellently. See:
      - [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-new/PZ-01-00-line-ratios.html]]
  - Next we need to start working through the 03-XX series to do the line moments
    - [X] Start with H alpha
    - [X] Now do [O III]
      - This works just fine for the PZ cube. The mean velocities show a higher amplitude of pattern noise than with the ESO cube, but in all other respects the PZ cube comes out ahead
    - [X] [S II] OK
    - [X] [O I] Badly affected by sky
    - [X] Blue lines
    - [X] Green and red lines
  - Now we can carry on with the other line ratio notebooks
    - [X] ~01-01-more-line-ratios~
- Naming convention
  - I will just add ~PZ~ prefix to the notebook names from ~data/ngc346-orig/~
- Do we want to be working with the median filtered cube?
  - Advantage that we do not need to bother with the continuum subtraction
  - Disadvantage is that this deviates from what I did with the ESO cube

*** Some more ideas about things to add to paper
**** DONE Density from Ha surface brightness

:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-04-24 Wed 11:58] \\
  This is now done better in [[id:C56D5FC4-B477-4D73-9748-6F8F3CF27B3D][The density from the Balmer line jump reconsidered]] below
:END:
- We see an increase in Ha at the inner edge of the bow shell, although it is pretty weak (about 40% of the background)
- So we need the following steps:
  1. We first need to calibrate this in physical surface brightness units
  2. Then we need to make the small correction for extinction
  3. Then convert to emission measure using an assumed effective recombination coefficient at the relevant temperature
  4. Finally, we have to estimate the path length through the shell. This is the most uncertain step. But we can assume it is similar to the chord length on the plane of the sky, or we could do the calculation based on the effective thickness
- It turns out that I already did a similar calculation for the He++ in the notebook [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-orig/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.py::So electron density of 11 pcc!**][01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.py]]
  - Note that this has not been ported to the PZ series yet
  - So I am going to carry on doing this in the same notebook, since it is already set up with all the pyneb stuff and the brightness maps
***** Prior work relevant to this
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2FF200A5-189A-440B-A441-F60FCD3A0C5F
:END:
- I already did work on the He++ line, which is described at
  - [[id:2B8BE02D-527B-413D-9FB9-B122B7D7B7EC][He II lines]] in this file
    - Refers to various calculations in jupyter notebooks, but then does more calculations
    - Working to determine He++ ionizing luminosity, Q_2
      - Q_2 = (2.8 +/- 0.1)e45 /s
      - Based on total He II 4686 flux of 2.04e-15 erg/s/cm^2 giving  L(4686) = 9.28e32 erg/s
      - Then we have Q_2 = \alpha_B(He^++) L(4686) / e(4686) (\Omega / 4\pi) where \alpha_B(He^++) and e(4686) come from pyneb
      - But the biggest uncertainty is going to be the solid angle, \Omega
    - Then calculation of electron density from the peak He II 4686 surface brightness
      - But this also depends on the He++ ionization fraction
  - [[id:BFFEAFD1-2FAD-47BC-BFAE-9075C9E23E24][Helium-plus ionizing luminosities]] in [[file:ngc-346.org]]
    - Mainly concerned with the He++ ionizing luminosity, Q_2, which it relates to the stellar atmosphere models
      - Q_2 = 2.8e45 /s which is more or less consistent with the POWR model ~SMC-OB-I 50-42~
    - Also calculates thickness of the He++ shell
      - h =  0.61 pc = 2 arcsec
    - And finally calculates the He++ ionization fraction
      - x = 0.63 and H density n = 13 pcc
  - Other calculations in the notebook [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-orig/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.py]]
    - Here is where I worked out various complementary quantities
    - The average ionization fraction of He++ for the entire path length through the ionized nebula is only about 0.02
      - I got 0.025 originally, but now it seems to be 0.016
    - This is consistent with the small observed dip in the He+ fraction from 5875/4861
    - So if we take seriously the idea that the bow shock is 30% contribution to the H Balmer emission, then this gives a x(He++) = 0.07 for the bow shock
      - By accounting for the smaller path length for He++ vs H+, we can push this up to 0.1
    - *this seems to contradict the previous calculation*
  - OK, so let's do the calculation for H+ too
***** Step 1: Calibrate in physical units
- Muse cube is in units of
  : 1e-20 erg / (Angstrom cm2 s)
  - With an implicit extra unit of per spaxel (0.2 arcsec x 0.2 arcsec)
  - We are summing along the wavelength axis, which has 1.4 Angstrom pixels
  - So final result is 1.489e-8 erg / s / cm^2 / sr
- Measured H beta brightness is 950 / (3 * 0.0105) = 3e4 Muse units
  - Fraction that we attribute to the bow shock is 0.3
  - So the bow shock brightness is 9e3 Muse units = 1.3e-4 erg / s / cm^2 / sr
  
***** Step 2: Correct for extinction
- For the bow shock region we measure E(B-V) = 0.097
- We calculate the extinction curve in the notebook [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-new/PZ-01-01-more-line-ratios.py]]
  - At H beta this gives A(H beta) = 0.33, so we need to multiply by 10**(0.4 0.33) = 1.36
- So intrinsic brightness is 1.8e-4 erg / s / cm^2 / sr
***** Step 3: Convert to emission measure
- The pyneb emission coefficient e(4861) is in erg cm^3 /s (of order 1e-25)
- So we have that
  \[I(4861) = \int n_e n_p[e(4861) / 4\pi] dz\]
- EM = \int n_e n_p dz = 4\pi I(4861) / e(4861)
- We have estimates of T = (15.5 \pm 1) kK from [Ar IV] or T = (13.8 \pm 0.6) kK from [O III]
- Taking the average of these, we get  e(4861) = 9.3e-26 erg cm^3 / s
- So final result for emission measure is EM = 2.4e22 cm^{-5}
***** Step 4: Estimate path length
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6357C2A7-544A-4B41-9ED5-2E713F966C73
:END:
- For the He II shell, I was using 60 pixels, but now that I look at it, I think that 40 pixels better represents the FWHM of the He II brightness
- For H I, I should use something bigger. probably best to use the FWHM from the [Ar IV] line, which is about 90 pixels
- So path length = 90 0.2 61700 au = 1.66e19 cm (or 5.4 pc)
***** Step 5: Estimate density
- Assuming that He is all singly ionized (a pretty good assumption), we can say that n_e \approx (1 + y) n_p = 1.08 n_p
- So n_p = sqrt(EM / 1.08 path length) = 37 cm^{-3}
- With an uncertainty of at least 25%
**** Line ratios
- We can look at correlations between relative line strength (wrt H beta)
- We can do this per-pixel and colored by the Zones from the DRL paper
- From what we have already in [[file:../notebooks/ngc346-new/eso-region-line-ratio-pairplot.pdf]] we can see the following
  - For the highest ionizations, we see some negative correlations, such as
    - [O III] vs [O II]
    - [Ar IV] vs [O III]
  - But at lower ionizations, all the correlations are positive
    - [O II] vs [O I]
    - [O I] vs [S II]
    - [O I] vs O I
    - O I vs [C I]
    - etcetera
  - But is this really worth doing?
**** Compare line ratios between optical and IR
- [2024-02-05 Mon]
  - We can show distribution of the optical ratios:
    [Ar IV]/[Ar III] vs [O III]/[S III]
  - Compare with infrared ratios
    [S IV]/[S III] vs [Ne III]/[Ne II]
  - Also bring in 14 mic / [S III] maybe
** Other bow shocks visible in JWST MIRI data
- [2024-01-18 Thu] Finally got around to looking at the public JWST MIRI data for NGC 346
- The W 3 bow is not the most prominent in these images, since it is so big and diffuse
- We see a more semi-circular north-facing one around SSN 13 (O4 V)
  - This shows a green tinge towards the inner edge since it shows up at 11 microns
- There are other smaller ones dotted throughout the nebula
  - SSN 31 (O7.5 V) to south of center for example, with parabolic shape
  - Tiny one over to east on outskirts of subcluster 10
  - One up in the Plume to the NNE in subcluster 14
    - but this one looks like a compact H II region
    - the H recomb line emission is confined to the interior of the bow
    - and PAH emission around the outside
    - but it looks as though the bow has trapped the i-front
** Lines to use for the bow shock
+ [X] He II 4685.71
  + 3-4 transition, so equivalent to Paschen \alpha
+ Lots of [Ar IV] lines!
  + [X] [Ar IV] 4740
  + [-] [Ar IV] 4711
    + Can give density diagnostic *but* it is blended with He I 4713
    + We can try and de-blend it using other helium lines
    + And it looks like the the He I contribution is small
  + [X] [Ar IV] red lines
    + 7170.5 and 7262.7 are clearly detected
      + But not 7237.4 strangely
      + Possibly because of contamination with C II
    + We can calculate a temperature from this!
      + See [[id:8B4C1164-B47D-47BE-9012-7DD0B661E014][[Ar IV] density and T indicators]]
    + Theory of [Ar IV] lines
      + (Ne, Te) diagnostic diagrams given in 
+ [Cl IV] 7530.8 and 8046.3
  + Unfortunately, the ratio gives us nothing since they come from the same upper state (S/N is not good enough to give useful reddening)
  + The auroral line is 5322.99 but it is not detected
  + [X] 7530.8 done, but contaminated by C II 7530.57
    + This is seen in the map, which shows emission from the filaments and clumps
    + The C II emission seems to come from much closer to the ionization front than it does in Orion
    + This is probably an ionization effect - the C^+ column in the ionized gas is much smaller because the spectrum is harder
    + But may also be a contribution of the low metallicity
  + [X] 8046.3
    + Also contaminated
+ He I 4713 - see above
+ [X] Look for other He I lines
  + [X] He I 4921.93
  + He I 5015.68 - on wing of 5007 but not excessively blended
  + [X] He I 5047.74 - weak
  + [X] Use PyNeb to find lines (or combinations of lines) that should be a fixed ratio to 4713, so that we can subtract it.
+ [X] Look for other He II lines
  + *none are usable* Or maybe they are
  + 4859.319 (4-8 Br \delta) - completely swamped by H\beta
  + 5411.52 (4-7 Br \gamma), which coincides with [Fe III]. Although that should not be a problem because there is no [Fe III] from the bow shock region (see below)
    + But it shows no emission - just photospheric absorption
    + Update [2022-10-26 Wed] Yes it does show emission
  + 6560.1 (4-6 Br \beta)
    + Probably too blended with H\alpha

  + 8236.78 (5-9) is clearly detected [2022-10-26 Wed]
+ [X] [Ar III] 5193.69
  - very weak and diffuse
  - does not seem to show any peak at the bow shock
  - T indicator with red [Ar III] line
+ [X] [Ar III] 7135.78
+ [X] H\alpha and H\beta to get reddening
  + [X] Extract line maps
  + [X] Fine correction for zero point offset
  + [X] Calculate reddening
    + We have a reddening map [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/data/ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits][ngc346-reddening-E_BV.fits]]
    + Average reddening of bow shock region is E(B-V) = 0.087
    + We have a SMC reddening curve that we calculate from pyneb using parameters from Gordon:2003l
    + I am ignoring the stellar absorption EW for now, but that needs to be dealt with if we ever look at more reddened regions. 
+ [X] [S III] lines for temperature
+ [X] [Cl III] lines for density
  + These are rubbish, unfortunately.  Signal-to-noise is too low to say anything at all
+ [ ] [S II] lines for density
  + This works much better - s/n is high and we are clearly away from the low-density limit
  + We can distinguish the denser gas close to ionization fronts on filaments from the lower-density diffuse component
    + The latter has densities of order
*** Additional high ionization lines [2022-10-22 Sat]
- This is a by-product of work on the deep neutral lines
**** O II 4649 and 4642
- 4649 looks like the other high ionization lines
  - It looks very different from [O III], which makes me think that it *must be fluorescence*
  - We should compare prediction of recombination contribution, given the O abundance determined from the forbidden lines
  - I suspect that it may mainly be fluorescence though
- 4642 looks a bit different, but that is mainly due to stars
  - Doing a cut, you can see an increase at the bow shock
**** Si III 5740
- This also looks similar to the [Ar IV] and [Cl IV] lines, but a bit more diffuse
- Not clear if it is recombination or fluorescence
  

*** Lines that that do NOT come from bow shock
+ [Fe III] 4987.20 - has broad range of emission, but concentrated in the E of the field
+ [Fe III] 4658.1 - weaker than 4987, but similar distribution
  + Except for the mYSO, where it is super-bright
+ Lots of other [Fe III] and [Fe II] lines that only show up in the mYSO
+ Si II 5041.03 - mYSO and SE clump (which may be another mYSO)
+ [N I] 5200 comes from filaments and clumps, but not from ionized gas
+ 
+
*** RGB velocity images in 3 channels for each line

**** Comments on the velocity patterns
- The siii 9069 line looks great now
- It shows more variation than the oiii lines, but they are correlated
  - It seems like the oiii has an additional diffuse component that has less variation
  - *AHA* that is not it at all - it is just that the d\lambda is smaller for the green lines than for the red lines, given the same velocity shift.  And our velocity pixels are fixed width in \lambda
    - If we shrink the range on the oiii then 4959 looks very similar to 9069 but with added artefacts
    - And 5007 also looks similar but with even more artefacts
  - The oi lines show even more variation than siii (and this is not explained by the different wavelengths)
- Things seem consistent wit the majority of the variation being due to brightness variations coupled with a general expansion along the line of sight
  - For instance, there are places where an apparent dust absorption causes the velocity to get bluer, which seems to be because the redder emission from the background layer is blocked
  - But there are other regions where a reduction in brightness is associated with redder velocities, which seems to be due to a gap between foreground blueshifted emission filaments

  Revisiting this, so we can apply to the ESO and PZ cubes in the big redo of the bow shock analysis
:END:

***** Return to 3-wav
- Looking at what I did before, I have a few doubts
- [X] First, how did we ever get m_2 larger than 2/3?
  - It turns out that this is spurious
  - The mean must lie in the range [-0.5, 0.5] so that it is within the B pixel, which by definition is the peak.
  - See my apple note [[file:Three-wave method for line extraction.pdf]["Three-wave method for line extraction"]]
- I now have the mapping from (m_1, m_2) to (\mu, \sigma, f) sorted
  - See [[id:AE951AB5-DA4E-426A-B1DD-C6D3F87B4122][Extended range mean wave and sigma from moments]]
  - The f is the fraction of the total flux that we lose by using only 3 pixels, which turns out to be mainly a function of m_2
  - The best results are obtained when \sigma is about 0.5, since that is when we are most sensitive
  - From the observations, I find that m_2 tends to vary from 0.5 to 0.6, which is great
    - This gives \sigma = 0.9 \pm 0.2
    - This implies f = 0.15 +/- 0.08, which is not to bad
    
***** Theory of 3-wav method
- We can use erf function to describe gaussian contribution to the three channels
- If we assume that channel intensities are A, B, C where B is peak and C > A
  - Say that C > A (if necessary invert velocity scale) so that mean velocity is between B and C
  - Then we can use C/A and (A+C)/B to characterise width and offset
  - Use a velocity scale {-1, 0, +1} for centers of channels A, B, C
    - Channel edges are [-1.5, -0.5], [-0.5, +0.5], [+0.5, +1.5]
  - Gaussian profile g(x, x0, sig) with x0 in range [0, +1]
  - So we can find the flux in each channel as
    - A = Int(g, -1.5 - x0, -0.5 - x0)
    - B = Int(g, -0.5 - x0, +0.5 - x0)
    - C = Int(g, +0.5 - x0, +1.5 - x0)
  - The integrals can be expressed as error functions:
    - Int(g, p - x0, q - x0) = (1/2) (erf((q  - x0)/ sig sqrt(2)) - erf((p - x0) / sig sqrt(2)))
    - Or Int(g, p - x0, q - x0) = E(q) - E(p)
      - with E(x) = (1/2) erf((x - x0) / sig sqrt(2))
    - If the profiles are not Gaussian, we can just replace erf by the CDF of the profile shape
  - So we get our two diagnostic ratios as
    - C/A = [E(+1.5) - E(+0.5)] / [E(-0.5) - E(-1.5)]
    - (A+C)/B = [E(-0.5) - E(-1.5) + E(+1.5) - E(+0.5)] / [E(+0.5) - E(-0.5)]
  - Alternatively, we could define moment-like linear functions
    - M_k = Sum(x^k F) = (-1)^k A + (0)^k B + (+1)^k C
    - M_0 = A + B + C
      - E(+1.5) - E(-1.5)
      - Signature -00+ 
    - M_1 = C - A (and same for all odd moments)
      - E(+1.5) + E(-1.5) - E(+0.5) - E(-0.5)
      - Signature +--+
    - M_2 = A + C (and same for all even moments)
      - E(-0.5) + E(+1.5) - E(-1.5) - E(+0.5)
      - Signature -+-+
  - Then we have the normalized moments
    - m_1 = M_1 / M_0
      - [+E(-1.5)-E(-0.5)-E(+0.5)+E(+1.5)] / [E(+1.5) - E(-1.5)]
      - This is exactly the same as the mean wavelength over the 3 channels
    - m_2 = M_2 / M_0
      - [-E(-1.5)+E(-0.5)-E(+0.5)+E(+1.5)] / [E(+1.5) - E(-1.5)]
      - This is the broadness parameter
  - [ ] Third alternative: use A and C directly
    - A / (A + B + C) = (m_2 - m_1) / 2
    - C / (A + B + C) = (m_2 + m_1) / 2
    - These have the advantage that they can be called Left and Right, or even Blue Fraction and Red Fraction
    - They tend to 1/3 when sigma is large
    - And they are both positive definite
    - The only disadvantage is that they do not separate into the significant and insignificant variations
    - And that we lose the approximate proportionality between \mu and m_1


***** TODO Sensitivity to noise of 3-wav method
- How does it compare with summing over a broader wave window?
- This will be different for strong lines or weak lines (as compared with the continuum)
- And also will depend on whether the "noise" in the continuum is independent in each pixel or not

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-05-03 Fri 11:23] \\
  We have made the annotated version of this graph
:END:
+ Annotated version is at [[file:../figs/3wav-extended-inverse-contours-annotated.pdf]]
+ Again, this is the same as the previous, except for allowing the peak to be outside of the central pixel, meaning |mu| > 0.5
+ There are two different kinds of forbidden regions
  + Where "forbidden" is only in the idea case. With real data, we might enter these regions due to noise
  + The lower forbidden regions represent negative fluxes in one of the flanking pixels, A or C
  + The upper forbidden regions are when mu is outside of the range [-0.5, 0.5]
  + This which means that we do not have the correct peak pixel
  + But, we might want to keep a consistent central pixel in a given region, so we might want to allow this

*** Ionization potentials
- Return to this [2024-01-30 Tue]
  - I want to expand the table and figure to include ions that are seen in the Spitzer spectra
  - These are
    - Ne II, III
    - Si I (this is the only element that I did not have)
    - S III, IV
- Where did I get these from? [2022-10-22 Sat]
  - Looks like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energies_of_the_elements_(data_page)
- [2024-02-01 Thu] Turns out that I had a mistake in my figure with the Spitzer images. It is not [Si IV], but [S IV] 10.51 micron that we see.
- This is good because we now have two adjacent stages of the same element

  + no particular concentration in [O III], He I, [Ar III], H I, etc
+ This suggests that the ionizing illumination is dominated by W 3 for E > 40.735 eV
  + But it does not dominate the illumination for E = 35 \to 40.735 eV or any of the softer bands
+ From the ACS H\alpha image, there is small region that shows the bow shell cleanly

+ We should have
  \[
  \frac{Ar^{3+}}{Ar^{2+}} =
  \frac{F \sigma}{\alpha n_e}
  \]
  + F is the ionizing flux for h\nu > 40.7 eV

    + *this one is bad* it is contaminated by C II 7236.19 or something
      + The map shows that most of the emission comes from the filament not from the bow shock
      + The contamination is not with C II, but is a deep neutral line at 7238.6, which seems slightly to red of the Ar IV emission

  + R_3 = 7263 / (4711 + 4740) =  2.5 / (60 + 85) = 0.01724 -> -1.763
    + gives T = 17500 K, approx
  + R_4 = 7171 / (4711 + 4740) = 3 / (60 + 85) = 0.02069 -> -1.684
    + but theoretically R_4 / R_2 = 1.33
    + We find R_4/R_2 = 7171 / 7238 = 3 / 3.5 = 0.8571, which must be due to contamination of 7238
    + So assuming R_2 = R_4 / 1.33, then R_2 = 0.02069 / 1.33 = 0.01556 -> -1.808
      + gives 17500 K, same as R_3
  + *Conclusion* Both R_3 and R_4 imply 17,500 K, while R_2 is hopelessly contaminated
  + *Except* I have not included the reddening

** Other diagnostic ratios
- [ ] [Ar III] 5192 is extremely weak, but we can maybe make a measurement of Te
- [Cl III] lines are too noisy to be useful


** Extraction of Spitzer spectra
- [2022-09-21 Wed] This is being done by JesÃºs
- I have provided him with a DS9 regions file with the following regions that correspond to the same regions that I have used to calculate the optical line excesses below
  - BS :: Bow Shock
    - Note that I have moved this a bit to the left to make sure that we include the He II emission zone
  - MIP :: Medium Ionization Peak
  - GLOB :: Globule
  - Each region has its associated BG background region
- Also I have added a couple of extra regions
  - YSO :: This is mYSO-C from Rubio et al 2018
  - FIL :: A clean section of neutral filament in a region where nebula and stellar emission is weak


*** Return to Spitzer spectra
- [2022-12-14 Wed] JesÃºs sent the spectra
  - Analyzed in notebook [[file:../notebooks/spitzer/01-jesus-ngc346-spitzer.ipynb]]
  - Made spectrum figure for BS, YSO, and background
    - YSO has silicate peaks
    - BS has spectrum approximately of warm black body at 145 K
    - Background has cool spectrum
  - Added figure to paper
- [2023-01-19 Thu] JesÃºs sent the spectral images
  - Turns out the [Ne III] traces bow shock quite well, as well as medium ionization zones
  - And [S IV] especially
  - [ ] [2024-02-02 Fri] Is the [S IV] strength because collisional deexcitation reduces its strength from the rest of the nebula? Seems unlikely
- [2023-01-20 Fri]
  - Realized that we need to use a better background so as not to oversubtract  the medium ionization lines
** Look at fractional excess in different features
- Compare the following
  - medium ionization peak
  - globules
  - bow shock
- In a bunch of different lines
  - measure in DS9

** Stellar parameters of W 3

+ Rivero-Gonzalez:2012w
  [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210531-223450.png]]
+ T_eff = 55000 K or 51000 K with an alternative solution
+ Wind parameters:
  + Mdot = 2.5e-6 Msun/yr
    + I no longer have faith in this value.
    + Supposedly it is from the Ha and He II 4686 lines, but these are not well produced by the Fastwind models.
      + The model predicts emission in the wings of the He II line, which is not seen at all
        [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-122838.png]]
      + Green is the observations.  Red, blue, black is different T_eff models. Red is supposedly the average of blue (cooler) and black (hotter), so it is odd that it does not lie between them.
      + Also the POWR models give He II 4686 emission for the high mass-loss case (SMC-OB-III grid)
    + Observed He II line from W3 from MUSE:
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130804.png]]
    + Same for W1 (O4 If+)
      [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210612-130853.png]]
    + So W1 has clear wind signature in the He II line
      + A velocity of 2000 km/s is \Delta\lambda = 31 \AA at 4686
      + The wings go from 4667 to 4710 -> +/- 20 \AA -> +/- 1280 km/s
    + [X] But note that they both have broad bumps in the wings of the H\beta line
      + *I now think these are not real*
        + I looked at the original spectra, and I think it is more likely to be a broad absorption feature around 4750 that has thrown off the continuum fit
        + Orion stars show the same, see Simon-Diaz paper
        + Might be some broad DIB
      + These don't seem to be predicted by any of the atmosphere models
      + /Could they be Raman scattering?/
        + No I don't think so
      + 4809 to 4919 \AA in H\beta -> +/- 55 \AA -> +/- 3000 km/s
      + Seems a bit excessive to be a velocity
  + Vw = 2800 km/s
  + Ram pressure at 1 pc
    + \rho V^2 = Mdot V / 4 \pi R^2
    + => = 3.687e-10 dyne / cm^2
    + P_ram / k = 2.67e6
    + **Lower Mdot value** Mdot = 2.2e-7 from Q_2 fitting of POWR models
      + Also, use R = 1.2 pc
      + P_ram = 2.2e-7 1.989e33 2800 1.0e5 / 3.15576e7 4 pi 1.2**2 3.085677582e18**2 = 2.253e-11 dyne / cm^2
      + P_ram / k = 1.632e+05
  + [2022-07-24 Sun] New measurements of wind parameters from Rickard:2022z
    + These agree with the values I got from the POWR models
  + Compare with thermal pressure of H II gas
    + P_gas / k = n_H (1 + y + 1 + 1.5 y)  T
      + Assuming x++ = 0.5
      + Also, ne = (1 + 1.5 y) n_H
        + y = 0.0824
        + P / k = ne T (2 + 2.5 y) / (1 + 1.5 y) = 1.963 ne T
      + Assume T = 13500 K
      + n = 1.632e+05 / 1.963 13500 = 6.2 pcc
    + Best estimate now is about n = 14 pcc from He II measurements
    + **Conclusions** We want a mass loss rate of about 5e-7 for ram pressure balance to work
      + This is slightly higher than we got from the He II analysis, but much less than the 2e-6 from before
  + We could also have a ram pressure component, so multiply by 1 + M^2
    + We can't have M much larger than 1, otherwise the density would have to be too low
    + And this makes no sense anyway, since the density measurement is for the inner rim, which must be static
+ Momentum efficiency of the wind:
  + Assume log L = 5.98
    + Radiation pressure at shell: P_rad = L / c 4 pi R^2 = 7.063e-10 dyne / cm^2
    + But only a fraction of this is trapped by shell
      + We estimate \tau_{abs} = 0.01 from infrared luminosity
      + And this gets multiplied by Q_P / Q_{abs} ~= 1.2
      + So the absorbed radiation pressure is 8.476e-12
        + => P/k = 6.139e+04
        + => n = 2.32 pcc
  + This means that the radiation support is not completely negligible
    + It amounts to about 20% of the total pressure
*** Atmosphere models for W3
+ The POWR OB models only go up to 50,000 K
  + This is just about acceptable if we take the lower T solution from Rivero-Gonzalez
+ There are 3 sets of SMC O star models with different wind strengths
+ I am first looking at the intermediate set
+ Model parameters for 50-42 (Teff = 50 kK, log g = 4.2)

** Photospheric absorption lines from W3
:PROPERTIES:
:ATTACH_DIR: /Users/will/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/docs/ngc-346_att
:END:
+ We might be able to get a radial velocity
  + (assuming it is not a binary)
+ There is an absorption line around 4740, which in most stars is to the red of the [Ar IV] emission line
  + But in W3 it is to the blue
  + So if it is the same line, this suggests a large negative radial velocity
  + But I need to check other lines.  It would be odd for nobody to have noticed this before
+ The He II 4686 line and H\beta 4881 look better
  + These show W3 is not special
  + And most stars are blue-shifted with respect to the gas
  + Although this is assuming that the lines are symmetrical, which may not be the case if they are affected by the stellar wind
+ [X] Or we could look at red lines - the wavelength resolution is better there
  + But the lines are weaker
  + For the hot stars, we have the narrow line N IV 6380, which could give a precise velocity
+ [ ] Castro:2018a use the He II 5411.5 line to measure the radial velocities
  + Yes, this looks the best line
    [[file:ngc-346_att/screenshot-20210620-144147.png]]
    This shows the profiles of several bright stars.  The thick yellow one is W 3.  It is considerably more blue-shifted than the others.
  + We should modify the moment calculations to work with the ~contdiv~ files and determine EW and mean velocity (and sigma, and skewness ...)
** Relevant papers on bow shocks in SMC
+ Gvaramadze:2011b
  - Massive runaway stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud
  - Detects several bow shocks in 24 micron emission
  - One is just SW of NGC 346, but it came from somewhere else
  - Sizes are 3 to 30 arcsec
    + 1 to 10 pc
+ Sheets:2013v
  - DUSTY OB STARS IN THE SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD. I. OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY REVEALS PREDOMINANTLY MAIN-SEQUENCE OB STARS
+ Adams:2013a
  - DUSTY OB STARS IN THE SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD. II. EXTRAGALACTIC DISKS OR EXAMPLES OF THE PLEIADES PHENOMENON?
  - Has an "interacting hotspot model" that seems to be very similar to a dust wave
** Possible runway of W3
- Look at the stellar radial velocity in more detail
  - Although the possibility of binarity means this cannot be relied upon
- What about transverse motions?
  - If W3 was ejected from the core of the cluster, then it has moved about 6 pc to the west, which is in the right direction to form the bow shock
  - Assuming an age of about 2 million years, then this gives a velocity of
    - 6 pc / 2e6 yr km
    - 6 3.085677582e18 / 2e6 3.15576e7 1.0e5 = 3 km/s
  - This is very slow and would not produce a supersonic bow shock
- The internal velocity dispersion within the nebula is larger than this
  - 6 km/s sigma(POS) from Javier paper
  - 9 km/s sigma(LOS) from
** The SNR to the E of the nebula
- Names: SNR J0059.4âˆ’7210, B0057-72.2, DEM S103, IKT 18
- Matsuura:2022v have a possible detection of 24 micron emission from the SNR
  - This is much weaker than the emission from the bow shock
- Maggi:2019q have x rays from the SNR, which show a nice circular morphology.  They do not see any significant diffuse x rays from the H II region

+ Basically, all fully ionized lines are similar: V = +162 +/- 2
+ [O I] and [S II] are significantly redder: V = 172 more or less
+ The [Ar IV] is similar to others: +162
+ But He II is redder: +157 +/- 2
  + But the difference may not be significant [2025-10-17 Fri 11:20]
** Velocity patterns in the nebula
- In low ionization lines, there is a clear N-S gradient
  - In the S, the foreground filaments are blueshifted: V = 150
  - In the N, the background globules are redshifted: V = 170
- In the ionized lines, the variation is much less: 160 to 165 approx in Ha
  - There is a flip in behavior between the N and S half of field
  - In both halves, the ionized velocity variation tracks the sii velocity
    - But in the S half, the ionized velocity is redshifted from sii
    - Whereas in N half it is blueshifted from sii
- So on the one hand, this looks like a sort of Hubble flow, as in a PN, with expansion speed increasing with radius
  - although it is not spherical since we see it varying on the plane of the sky
- But on the other hand, we could interpret it as that the neutral globules are accelerated by the rocket effect, and then the photoevaporation flows largely undo that for the ionized  gas by flowing inwards in the frame of the i front

  I want to concentrate all the He II notes in this section, or at least to have links to all the other places that I have worked on this
:END:
+ I have already tried to do this analysis in notebook 01-02:
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.py]]
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/muse-hii-regions/notebooks/01-02-yet-more-line-ratios.ipynb]]

+ But I was getting inconsistent results, so I am going to start again
  + [2024-04-12 Fri] Revisit these calculations, now that I am more confident in the He++ fraction and electron density. 
+ I had used a few different approaches:
  1. (Comes second in the notebook). Use the total He II luminosity to derive the ionizing photon rate Q_2.  The only assumption here is that all the He II emission comes from recombination (in photoionization equilibrium).
     - We find a flux of 2.78e-15 erg/s/cm^2
     - This corresponds to a luminosity of 1.27e33 erg/s = 0.33 Lsun
     - PyNeb is used to get emissivity of 4686 and \alpha_B(He^++)
       - but I had assumed T = 18000 and 12000
       - Switched this now to 12500, 13800, 15500 as more representative of measured values
     - This gives Q_2 = \alpha_B(He^++) L(4686) / e(4686) (\Omega / 4\pi)
       - Q_2 = (3.8 +/- 0.1)e45
     - The uncertainty is probably dominated by uncertainty in covering factor of the bow shock shell, so is much larger than stated here.
       - I had assumed +/-75 degrees end cap
     - This can be compared with stellar atmosphere models
       - See [[id:262D3FA1-80BD-4225-BE22-7970BD1FF6FF][Rearrange and rescale the models]] in this file. 
  2. (First in notebook).  Use peak He II brightness to estimate the electron density
  3. (Not in notebook, but see [[id:CC0FB6FC-FE95-4F68-B4F4-6CD1096297A2][Consistency check on the ionization fraction and thickness of the He II zone]] in this file). Estimate the thickness of the He++ zone. 

**** DONE He II peak brightness
CLOSED: [2024-04-24 Wed 12:02]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-04-24 Wed 12:02] \\
  This is now mainly superseded by [[id:89812E2B-AB5E-40BB-9554-381D8B61119D][Rematch for the He++ ionization fraction at inner edge]], but at  some point I need to go through it to see if anything needs salvaging. It has some important details on the estimation of various parameters, which are not found elsewhere
:END:
- I am getting inconsistent results for the He++ ionization fraction in the bow shock shell from two different approaches.
  1. The He II/He I ratio, which favors a low ratio: 0.1
  2. The local ionization balance at the inner edge, which favors a high ratio: 0.7
- To get a third opinion, I am going to try to use the peak He II 4686 brightness to estimate the ionizing flux at the inner edge of the shell
  - This is similar to the estimate in the notebook of the ionizing luminosity from the He II luminosity


***** Ionization equilibrium and He II brightness of the shell
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       C705A98C-81F3-46E2-9E63-B754EE5EC94C
:END:
- So we have F = \int n_e n_{He^{++}} \alpha_B(He^{++}) d r from ionization balance across the shell
- And we have I(He II 4686) = \int n_e n_{He^{++}} [e(He II 4686) / 4\pi] d z from the He II line luminosity
- So we can write F = 4\pi I(He II 4686) [ \alpha_B(He^{++}) / e(He II 4686) ] [ \int d r / \int d z ]

***** Observed He II brightness
- I have the muse brightness unit as 1.4e-20 erg/s/cm^2/pixel with a pixel scale of 0.2 arcsec
  - which is 1.5e-8 erg/s/cm^2/sr
- The peak He II brightness is 400 in MUSE units
- The extinction is estimated to be A(4686) = 0.34
- So intrinsic brightness is 1.5e-8 400 10**(0.4 0.34) = *8.21e-6 erg/s/cm^2/sr*
   
***** Recombination coefficient for He++
- For the inner rim of the shell, the T may be even higher than the [Ar IV] temperature, but we have no way of knowing
- So probably best to use the 15500 K value
- This implies \alpha_B(He^{++}) = 1.1e-12 cm^3/s
- [ ] pyneb gives reference as SH95 - need to check what paper this is (Seaton?)
- Also we have an equation from Draine
  - 2.54e-13 Z^2 (T_4/Z^2)^b
  - where b = -0.8163 - 0.0208 ln(T_4/Z^2)
  - for T_4 = 1.55, Z = 2, we get T_4/Z^2 = 0.3875, b = -0.797, \alpha_B =  2.54e-13 4 (0.3875)**-0.797 = *2.163e-12 cm^3/s*
    - [ ] This is about double what I got from pyneb, which is odd

***** Path lengths through shell
- The radial path length \int d r is the thickness of the shell
  - From the images, the FWHM looks to be about 10 pixels, or 2 arcsec = 1.846e18 cm
  - The seeing is about 5 pixels, or 1 arcsec, which should be subtracted in quadrature: d r = 1.73 arcsec = 8.65 pix = 1.6e18 cm
- Line of sight path length \int d z can be approximated by the chord length through the projected shell on the plane of the sky (assuming cylindrical symmetry)
  - In the section [[id:6357C2A7-544A-4B41-9ED5-2E713F966C73][Step 4: Estimate path length]] above, I estimated the chord length to be 40 pixels
- So finally the ratio is \int d r / \int d z = 8.65 / 40  = *0.22*

***** Putting it all together to find the He++ ionizing photon flux
- F = 4\pi I(He II 4686) [ \alpha_B(He^{++}) / e(He II 4686) ] [ \int d r / \int d z ]
- F = 4 pi 0.25 8.21e-6  2.163e-12 / 9.59e-25 = *5.82e7*
  - Units: sr (erg/(s cm^2 sr)) cm^3/s / (erg cm^3/s) =  *s^-1 cm^-2*   

***** Converting flux to an ionizing luminosity Q_2
- The radius of the shell is 20 pixels, or 4 arcsec, which is 4 9.23e+17 cm = 3.692e18 cm = 1.2 pc
- So area of full sphere with that radius is 4 pi 3.692e18**2 = 1.71e38 cm^2
- Implying that Q_2 = 5.82e7 1.71e38 = *9.96e45 s^-1*
- This is even higher than what I was getting before!!!

- This follows directly from the first equation in [[id:C705A98C-81F3-46E2-9E63-B754EE5EC94C][Ionization equilibrium and He II brightness of the shell]] above
- n_e n_{He^{++}} = F / \alpha_B(He^{++}) dr = 5.82e7 / 2.163e-12 1.846e18 = *14.6 cm^-6*
- This should be equal to n^2 y_He x_e x_{He^{++}}
  - So with y_He = 0.08, x_e = 1.08 we have n^2 x_{He^{++}} = 169 cm^-6
- Assuming y_He = 0.08, x_e = 1.08, n = 25 cm^-3, we get x_{He^{++}} = 14.6 / 25**2 0.08 1.08 = 0.27

  I am updating this to incorporate the new determination of the H density from [[id:C56D5FC4-B477-4D73-9748-6F8F3CF27B3D][The density from the Balmer line jump reconsidered]] below
:END:
- The original calculation from 2021 in [[id:6A6EC6C8-4754-4B62-8A8D-231CCFC9C677][Estimating He++ ionization fraction]] in the [[file:ngc-346.org]] notebook, together with the ionizing luminosities from the stellar atmosphere models
- The key additional data that we need is the photoionization cross section for He+
  - This is hydrogenic, so it just scales as sigma(Z, E) = (sigma_0 / Z^2) (E/Z^2 E_0)^{-3}
  - At threshold it is therefore sigma_0 / Z^2 = 1.5e-18 cm^2
  - Question is, what is the average value over the He II ionizing spectrum? This will depend on the spectra slope. But could easily give a reduction by a factor of 2.
  - From the stellar SEDs, it looks like continuum is very steep there
- Local ionization balance is
  - F \sigma n(He+) = \alpha_B n_e n(He++)
  - x / (1-x) = F \sigma / \alpha_B n_e
- We can define a characteristic hydrogen density corresponding to 50% ionization
  - n* = F \sigma / x_e \alpha_B = 5.82e7 0.5 1.5e-18 / 1.08 2.163e-12 = 19 cm^-3
    - This assumes that the mean cross section is 0.5 times the threshold value
    - Also assumes that He++ contribution to electrons is small
  - x / (1-x) = n* / n
  - So we would need n = 180 to get x = 0.1
- But from [[id:8AC74CFB-86FA-4705-B13B-028ED6E2BAE5][Finding product of electron and He++ densities]] we also have n^2 x = 169
- It seems that these two equations have similar derivations, so maybe things can be simplified
  1. F =  \alpha_B \int n_e n(He^{++}) dr : Global through shell
  2. F = \alpha_B n_e n(He^{++}) / \sigma n(He+) : Local at inner edge of shell
- This has the solution
  - x_0 = 1 - \tau^-1
  - where \tau is the optical depth that the shell would  have if all its He were in the form of He+
  - \tau = \sigma n(He) dr = \sigma y n dr
    - where n is the hydrogen density and y = 0.0824 is the He abundance
- Uncertainties in the ingredients that go into \tau
  - cross section \sigma = (0.5 +/- 0.25) 1.5e-18 cm^2 (relative uncertainty 50%)
  - y = 0.0824 +/- 0.004 (relative uncertainty 5%)
  - n = 19 +/- 8 cm^-3 (relative uncertainty 40%) from the jump in H alpha surface brightness
  - dr = 8.6 +/- 2.0 pixels (relative uncertainty 23%) giving 1.6e18 cm
- Putting it all together
  - \tau = 0.5 1.5e-18 0.0824 19 1.6e18 = 1.88
  - x = 0.71
  - Adding the relative uncertainties in quadrature gives sqrt(0.5**2 + 0.05**2 + 0.4**2 + 0.2**2) = 0.67
  - **Final answer**
    - So \tau = 1.88 +/- 1.26 and *x = 0.47 +/- 0.36*
    - Note that the errors on x are not realistic, since x is positive definite and tau = 1 (x = 0) is in the +/- 1 sigma interval. Physically, tau cannot be larger than 1. So, what we have really is an upper limit.
      | sigmas |  tau |    x |
      |--------+------+------|
      |      0 | 1.88 | 0.47 |
      |      1 | 3.14 | 0.68 |
      |      2 |  4.4 | 0.77 |
      |      3 | 5.66 | 0.82 |
      #+TBLFM: $2=1.88 + $1 1.26::$3=1-1/$2;f2
    - So the 1 sigma upper limit is x < 0.68 and the 3 sigma upper limit is x < 0.82
    - But in the other direction, we cannot exclude the possibility that x is very small. 
- What empirical data and assumptions go into this estimate?
  1. H density in shell
     - Comes from Ha brightness jump
     - Plus assumption of cylindrical symmetry to get geometric depth from chord length
  2. Shell thickness
  3. He abundance
  4. He+ photoionization cross section

  Reworking this in the light of findings from [[id:89812E2B-AB5E-40BB-9554-381D8B61119D][Rematch for the He++ ionization fraction]]
:END:
- Result from the shell analysis at inner edge is x_0 = 0.5 (+0.2, -0.5)
  - So really an upper limit
- Result from the He II/He I ratio is that \langle x \rangle = 0.015
  - [ ] But what are the errors on this?
  - This is the peak of the mean He++ fraction, which is the product of the shell He++ fraction and the shell fractional contribution to the emission measure (ignoring variations in T because they are small)
  - Both of these will vary with depth into the shell
    - But the longest path through shell is at the projection of the *inner* edge (the classical horn-shaped profile of a constant emissivity shell)
    - So, given that x is also biggest at the inner edge, the peak in \langle x \rangle should be exactly at the inner edge
    - [ ] *However* the seeing of 1 arcsec is about half the shell thickness, and this blurring may reduce the peak in \langle x \rangle
- So on the face of it, we need that the shell is only 2% of the total emission measure
  - This is much less then one would naturally think, which would be about 20% of total
- But we should really be asking, what is the required tau such that x = 0.1, and how confidently we can exclude that value
  - Given that \tau = 3.5 +/- 2.2, then \tau = 1 (small x) can only be excluded at 1.1 sigma, which is not that much
  - One way of achieving it would be to have a 3.5 times lower density n = 10 cm^-3
  - Alternatively, the density could be just a bit lower (n = 20 cm^-3) and the cross section down to 0.25 times the threshold value, which is perhaps reasonable when integrated over the shell due to the hardening of the spectrum

- Optionally, we could subtract off the far background too, which is 0.05 to 0.10
  - Question is, whether this is included in the MUSE surface brightness or not
  - I have decided to subtract it (0.075+/-0.025) and it does not make much difference
  - 
****** Conversion to physical brightness units
- From the FITS header we have the following photometric keywords
  : PHOTMODE= 'ACS WFC1 F658N MJD#53201.6669' / observation con
  : PHOTFLAM= 1.94917473333333E-18 / inverse sensitivity, ergs/cm2/Ang/electron
  : PHOTZPT =                -21.1 / ST magnitude zero point
  : PHOTPLAM=        6.5839512E+03 / Pivot wavelength (Angstroms)
  : PHOTBW  =        3.7009235E+01 / RMS bandwidth of filter plus detector
- Also, I guess we do not need the exposure time since we also have
  : BUNIT   = 'ELECTRONS/S'        / Units of science product                       
- So the bowshock excess brightness of 0.05 elec/s is equivalent to
  : 0.05 1.94917473333333E-18 = 9.75e-20 erg/s/cm^2/A/pixel
- Pixel size is 1.38888888888896E-05 deg = 0.05 arcsec = 5.87609659544e-14 sr
  : 9.75e-20 / 5.87609659544e-14 = 1.66e-6 erg/s/cm^2/A/sr
- Now we need the effective width of the filter, which is not the same as the ~PHOTBW = 37~ parameter
  - We have ~FWHM = 136~ and ~RANGE = 180~ but neither are the rectangular width, which is W_eff = 74.82 Angstrom according to [[http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/svo/theory/fps3/index.php?mode=browse&gname=hst&gname2=ACS_WFC&asttype=][this page]]
  - The redshift is about 200 km/s, or 4 Angstrom, which is small compared with the filter width, so it should still be in the flat part with maximum transmission
- So we get the final answer of
  : 1.66e-6 74.82 = 1.24e-4 erg/s/cm^2/sr
- This is with a brightness fraction of 0.1 and is almost the same as we previously obtained for H beta, assuming a brightness fraction of 0.3. So this is fully consistent, given that Ha/Hb is about 3
- 
***** Extinction corrected H alpha surface brightness
- We have A(Ha) = 0.2 for E(B-V) = 0.097, so intrinsic brightness is 10**(0.4 0.2) = 1.20
- Final result: 1.49e-4 erg/s/cm^2/sr
***** Correction for the continuum
- Fractional contribution of continuum is W_eff / EW(Ha)
- We can get the EW(Ha) from the MUSE observations
  - I now do this in PZ-01-01-more-line-ratios.py
  - The result is about 550 Angstrom for the bow shock
    : 74.82 / 550 = 0.136
- So the corrected brightness is 1.49e-4 (1 - 0.136) = 1.29e-4 erg/s/cm^2/sr
- Coincidentally, this exactly cancels out the extinction correction
***** Correction for [N II] 6583 contamination
- This can actually be neglected since the results from the Mabel paper show that 6583/6563 is only 0.03 in Zone II and 0.01 in Zone III, and 6583 is not detected at all in Zone IV
- So it might not 1% off the denominator - hardly worth bothering about
***** Find e(6563) and hence the emission measure
#+begin_src python :return eha
  import pyneb as pn
  hi = pn.RecAtom('H', 1)
  eha = hi.getEmissivity(tem=[13800, 15500], den=1e2, wave=6563)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 2.59886957e-25 | 2.32174194e-25 |

- So the average is 2.46e-25 erg/s/cm^3
- Emission measure is 4\pi I(6563) / e(6563)
  : 4 pi 1.29e-4 / 2.46e-25 = 6.59e21 /cm^5
***** Uncertainty budget for the emission measure
- We have a 30% uncertainty in the observed brightness, which is what will dominate
- Everything else is much better constrained
***** Path length and conversion to density
- As previously, we assume 90 pixels = 18 arcsec for the path length
- 18 arcsec = 18 61700 au = 1.66e19 cm
- But we need to admit a considerable uncertainty in this: say 50%
- So density is sqrt(6.59e21 / 1.08 1.66e19) where 1.08 assume He+ dominates, which will be true for the H alpha shell
  - Final H density: **n = (19 +/- 8) cm^-3**
  - Uncertainty is found as sqrt((0.3**2 + 0.5**2)/2) = 40%
***** Brightness of supernova remnant
- The semicircular shell is a bit higher than the bow shock in brightness
- About 0.25+/-0.01 - 0.17+/-0.01 = 0.08 +/- 0.02
- Path length is twice as long though. Chord length is 36 arcsec
- So these cancel out and the density comes out to be similar: 20 pcc
  
**** Covering fraction of the He II shell
- I have already calculated this a few times. The first time, I assumed a 75 degree opening angle, but I never wrote down my reasoning
- And then I did [[id:BC7D457E-10D9-45E7-8DFC-9A3E736DE519][Previous calculation that on reflection is too small]] and got 54 degrees, but that was based on the erroneous assumption that I should be using the half-maximum width or similar
- But really I need to use the full width, since I am summing all the He II emission from the shell, so the covering fraction is that of my whole integration box
- So assuming radius of 20 pixels and a lateral extent of 25 +/- 5 pixels, the half-cone angle is
  - arctan((25 +/- 5) / 20) = 51 +/- 6
  - This is depressingly close to my previous estimate, so it will also give an uncomfortably large He++ ionizing luminosity and hence ionization fraction
  - /Addendum/ [2024-04-19 Fri] I now find the high ionization fraction independent of the ionizing luminosity, so the previous objection is probably moot

***** Previous calculation that may be too small

:END:
- [2024-04-14 Sun 14:12] New estimate:
  - radius of He II shell is 4 arcsec = 20 pixels
  - Lateral extent of He II shell is 18 +/- 3 pixels
    - This is a rather generous estimate of the uncertainty depending on whether we take the half-brightness point or the steepest part of the profile
  - So angle is arctan((18 +/- 3)/20) = 42 +/- 5 deg
    - or arcsin((18 +/- 3)/20) = 64 +/- 20
    - neither of these are quite right. First is wrong because shell is not flat, second is wrong because shell is not circle centered on star
    - In reality, planitude is about 2, so we should have an intermediate value: say 54 +/- 16
    - covering factor \Omega/4\pi is then (1 - cos(theta)) / 2 = 0.21 +/- 0.11
  - This is smaller than I was previously using, since I had assumed 75 deg opening angle? On reflection, that would  seem to be too large

    - Blended with low ionization, but recoverable
    - Peak is about 15 over BG of 1

  - Mabel did this for the entire nebula, getting about unity => n = 100 +/- 20
  - The lines are very weak, but it looks to me like we have 4986/4658 = 2, implying a lower density
    - That is in the E of nebula, it is more like unity around the bow shock area
- We also have the [Fe III] 5270 line, which can possibly be used as  T indicator

        - First one might be [Ni I] 7464.367 except wavelength is not close enough
      - 7221 extremely weak
      - very weak: 7195, 7179, 7144 (broad), 7111, 7106
        - Second one could be Fe I 7179.9948
          - 3d7.(4F).4s-3d6.(5D).4s.4p.(3Po)
          - a3F-z5Do
          - 4 - 4
          - A = 8.463e+02 /s, which is largest for its multiplet
      - 7092.5 (blend with red wing), 7057.5 very weak
      - 7044
        - not a deep neutral line, but a very weird distribution
      - 7039 very weak
        - looks like a neutral fluorescence line (except not seen from YSO)
      - 7011 very weak
      - 7002 very weak except for YSO
        - clearly is O I 7001.92
      - 6987 weak
      - 6945 neutral only, 6963 super weak
      - Nothing much can be seen in range 6860-6940 due to O_2 telluric band
      - 6817 super weak, 6847 very weak
      - 6795 highly ionized bow shock line
        - This is [K IV] 6795.1, which is the weaker doublet member to 6101.79
        - It is good that I found this again independently
      - 6776, 6698 very weak, 6656 very weak, 6646 very weak
        - [Ni II] 6667 only from YSO
      - 6636, 6628
        - These flank either side of the 6634 Raman O I absorption feature
      - 7791, 7782 (blended wing to blue), 7768
      - 7747 (in blue wing of [Ar III] 7751), 7741 very weak
      - 7707 very weak,  7724 super super weak
      - These are in range 7590-7700 that is affected by telluric O_2 absorption band, so I am not sure how real they are:
        - But they do show up cleanly in the GLOB sample, so there must be something there
        - 7663 (broad multiplet/band), 7637 weak, 7628 weak
          - these look slightly more diffuse than the other lines, maybe
      - 7577 super weak
      - 7567 has something in FIL and NEUT-C, but I do not know if it is real
        - *No, this is sky*
      - 7531 [Cl IV] in bow shock
      - 7527 weak, 7488.5 weak
        - also diffuse
      - 7468.5, 7442 very weak, 7254
        - Clearly these are
          - N I 7468.31, 7442.30
          - O I 7254.15
        - Distribution much smoother than the other lines
        - Bright from mYSO-C and from Raman clump
      - 7463 is a clear deep neutral lines, right in the midst of those fluorescent lines
      - 7707 weak
        - This is close to Fe I 7708.8389, which is same multiplet as 8151
        - /Is this the same line?/ It is off by nearly 2 angstrom
        - *It turns out I was using the wrong velocity*
          - Should be +160 for the BG filaments or 150 for the foreground ones
        - [2022-09-23 Fri] But there are at least two lines here. We  need to investigate further
        - [2022-10-03 Mon] And these lines are strong from neutral regions, that is if they are not sky
          - Turns out that longer wave one is sky, at 7718.69 observed
          - Shorter one is certainly a neutral line, but also seems contaminated by sky
      - 7724 very weak
    - 6000 to 6530
      - 6503 very weak
      - 6460 very weak
        - This is certainly not C II 6462, which is perhaps detected from the bow shock region, but is even weaker
      - 6451.5 weak, 6448 very weak
      - 6434 very weak
      - 6371.5 ionized
        - probably Si II 6371.36
      - 6347
        - likely to be Si II 6347.11
        - Note that this looks like Si II 5978.93 and 5957.56 in its spatial distribution
      - 6270.3 very weak
      - 6221.6 very weak
      - 6084.2 weakest ever
      - 6046 also very weak
        - clearly is O I 6046.23
      - 6038 extremely weak
      - 5979, 5958 weak
        - Clearly Si II 5978.93 and 5957.56
      - 5740 very weak
        - Probably Si III 5739.73
        - Only seen in *bow shock area*, to W of W 3
      - 5577 badly affected by sky
        - But we can just about detect the redshifted [O I] line from the nebula, especially in the globules just south of W 2
      - 5412 He II emission from inside edge of bow shock, but affected by stellar absorption
  - YSO only
    - 7999 (maybe [Fe II] 7999.47) maybe also from jet (?) in globule
    - 8107, 8111, 8115 (maybe seen in Orion)
    - 8126 maybe Ca I 8125.31
      - seen faintly in 3 globules in addition to YSO, including one of the foreground globules
    - 8188
      - observed in Orion but unidentified?
      - also seen in lower globule (different one from above)
    - 7468.5 similar to 8188, likely to be N I 7468.3
    - 7452 probably [Fe II] 7452.54
    - 7442 probably N I 7442.30
    - 7412 probably [Ni II] 7411.61
    - 7378 probably [Ni II] 7377.83
    - 7172 probably [Fe II] 7172.00
- Si II 5041
  - This is very weak
  - But with a strange clump in the bottom left corner
    - Just north of the star at 0:59:08.5822 -72:10:57.667
- At about 7262 angstrom
  - No, of course this is Ar IV 7263
- At about 7500
  - He I 7499.85
  - But it seems more bow shock-y than the other He I lines
- Cl IV 7531 looks pretty strong
- Cl IV 8046 is contaminated, but it could be removed, perhaps by N I
- [K IV] 6101.79 ( ^3P_2 - ^1D_2 )
  - Weaker than the [Ar IV] lines, but definitely detected from the bow shock
  - There is another line of same multiplet at 6795.1 that we should look for
    - ^3P_1 - ^1D_2
    - Strangely, we do not seem to have a continuum-subtracted cube that covers this wavelength. The Ha raman wing section stops at 6800
    - Now we have it, and the line is detected, but it is very weak
    - Weaker than 6101.79 by a factor of 4 *as expected*
  - This is isoelectronic to [Ar III]
    - Equivalent lines are 7135.8 and 7751.1
    - Of which the redder one is also 4 times weaker (unlike what I first thought)


*** TODO Find the K+++ / Ar+++ ratio
- This can come from the [K IV] lines
- We could also do the Cl+++ abundance form the [Cl IV] lines
  - Best to use 7531 even though it is weaker than 8046 because it is less blended with low ionization lines


*** What is origin of second peak in [Ar IV]?
- This is centered on 0:59:07.3344,-72:10:48.188 in the lower left of the field
- The only O star there is MPG 500, which is classified as O6V
  - That does not seem to be hot enough to generate much [Ar IV]
  - On the other hand, Orion has some [Ar IV] emission, so it could be that
  - Alternatively, it could be related to the SNR to the East
*** Density and/or dust opacity from the infrared emission
+ From section 2 of Paper III
  + \Sigma = \tau / \kappa
  + \rho = \Sigma / h = \tau / \kappa h = n m
+ We have
  + \tau = 0.01
  + \kappa = 600 \kappa_600 cm^2/g
  + h = H R = 1.2 H pc
  + m = 2e-24 g
+ This gives us
  + n = \tau / \kappa h m = 0.01 / 600 \kappa_600 H 1.2 3.085677582e18 2e-24
  + => n = 2.251 / \kappa_600 H
+ So with H = 1, and using the He II determination of 13 pcc for n
  + => \kappa_600 = 2.251 / 13 = 0.173
  + => \kappa = 104 cm^2 / g
  + This seems reasonable for a SMC metallicity
+ We can convert this to a \sigma per H
  + \sigma = 2.1e-20 cm^2 / H
